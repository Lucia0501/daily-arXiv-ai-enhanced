Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本研究应用机器学习分析EEG和fMRI数据，成功识别耳鸣患者的神经生物标志物，树基分类器和混合模型在耳鸣分类中表现出色，准确率最高达99.0%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 耳鸣影响10-15%的人口但缺乏客观诊断生物标志物，需要开发基于神经影像的客观诊断方法。

Method: 分析64通道EEG数据（80人）和静息态fMRI数据（38人）。EEG提取微状态特征和全局场功率小波图像，fMRI使用切片卷积神经网络和混合模型（VGG16、ResNet50结合决策树、随机森林、SVM）。采用5折交叉验证评估性能。

Result: EEG微状态分析显示耳鸣患者gamma波段微状态B出现率降低（健康：56.56 vs 耳鸣：43.81，p<0.001）。树基分类器准确率达98.8%，VGG16在小波变换EEG上达95.4%（delta）和94.1%（alpha）。fMRI切片17准确率达99.0%，混合VGG16-决策树模型达98.95%±2.94%。

Conclusion: EEG和fMRI提供了有效的耳鸣神经生物标志物，树基和混合模型性能优越，表明耳鸣是多网络障碍需要多模态分析。

Abstract: Objective: Tinnitus affects 10-15% of the population yet lacks objective
diagnostic biomarkers. This study applied machine learning to EEG and fMRI data
to identify neural signatures distinguishing tinnitus patients from healthy
controls. Methods: Two datasets were analyzed: 64-channel EEG recordings from
80 participants (40 tinnitus, 40 controls) and resting-state fMRI data from 38
participants (19 tinnitus, 19 controls). EEG analysis extracted microstate
features across four to seven clustering states and five frequency bands,
producing 440 features per subject. Global Field Power signals were also
transformed into wavelet images for deep learning. fMRI data were analyzed
using slice-wise convolutional neural networks and hybrid models combining
pre-trained architectures (VGG16, ResNet50) with Decision Tree, Random Forest,
and SVM classifiers. Model performance was evaluated using 5-fold
cross-validation based on accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
Results: EEG microstate analysis revealed altered network dynamics in tinnitus,
particularly reduced gamma-band microstate B occurrence (healthy: 56.56 vs
tinnitus: 43.81, p < 0.001) and diminished alpha coverage. Tree-based
classifiers achieved up to 98.8% accuracy, while VGG16 on wavelet-transformed
EEG yielded 95.4% and 94.1% accuracy for delta and alpha bands, respectively.
fMRI analysis identified 12 high-performing axial slices (>=90% accuracy), with
slice 17 reaching 99.0%. The hybrid VGG16-Decision Tree model achieved 98.95%
+/- 2.94% accuracy. Conclusion: EEG and fMRI provided effective neural
biomarkers for tinnitus classification. Tree-based and hybrid models
demonstrated superior performance, highlighting tinnitus as a multi-network
disorder requiring multimodal analysis.

### [2] [Monitoring Real-Time ECG Signals on Mobile Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21789)
*Beyazit Bestami Yuksel*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 开发了一个基于移动系统的实时心电图监测系统，通过非侵入方法采集ECG信号并在移动设备上图形化显示，当信号异常时提供警报反馈。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实现便携式实时心电图监测，为远程医疗和紧急干预提供技术基础。

Method: 使用Visual Studio .NET平台开发软件，通过Einthoven三角法放置电极，串口传输数据，在移动设备上图形化显示ECG信号并设置阈值警报。

Result: 成功开发出完全便携的实时ECG监测系统，能够检测异常信号并发出警报。

Conclusion: 该系统为未来多用途医疗系统（如在线患者监测、位置跟踪和除颤干预）奠定了基础。

Abstract: This study focuses on the connection of a development kit that enables
real-time monitoring of electrocardiogram (ECG) signals using a mobile system.
A software developed on the Visual Studio .NET platform reads real-time ECG
signals from the human body through non invasive methods and displays them
graphically on the mobile system. ECG electrodes placed on specific areas of
the body using the method known as Einthoven's triangle. Subsequently, the
software initiates data flow through the serial port, and these data displayed
as signal values on the mobile device's screen via a graphical interface. When
the monitored ECG signals fall below a certain threshold or reach a critical
value, the system provides feedback with an alert based on medical data. The
developed system is fully portable. Additionally, the implemented system has
the potential to form the basis for a multi-purpose system in the future, such
as online patient monitoring, patient location tracking, and even initial
intervention using the defibrillation method.

### [3] [Adaptive Split-MMD Training for Small-Sample Cross-Dataset P300 EEG Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21969)
*Weiyu Chen,Arnaud Delorme*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出AS-MMD方法解决小样本P300检测中的跨数据集迁移问题，结合目标加权损失、分离批归一化和RBF-MMD正则化，在严格小样本条件下优于目标域单独训练和池化训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当只有少量标记试次时，单试次P300检测很困难。使用大源数据集增强小目标集时会出现跨数据集偏移问题。

Method: 提出AS-MMD方法：1）目标加权损失与热身训练；2）分离批归一化；3）参数自由的RBF-MMD正则化。基于EEG Conformer实现，与骨干网络无关。

Result: 在两个视觉oddball ERP数据集上测试，AS-MMD在两种迁移方向上都优于目标域单独训练和池化训练（Active Visual Oddball：准确率/AUC 0.66/0.74；ERP CORE P3：0.61/0.65），改进具有统计显著性。

Conclusion: AS-MMD能有效解决小样本P300检测中的跨数据集迁移问题，消融实验证明三个组件都对性能提升有贡献。

Abstract: Detecting single-trial P300 from EEG is difficult when only a few labeled
trials are available. When attempting to boost a small target set with a large
source dataset through transfer learning, cross-dataset shift arises. To
address this challenge, we study transfer between two public visual-oddball ERP
datasets using five shared electrodes (Fz, Pz, P3, P4, Oz) under a strict
small-sample regime (target: 10 trials/subject; source: 80 trials/subject). We
introduce Adaptive Split Maximum Mean Discrepancy Training (AS-MMD), which
combines (i) a target-weighted loss with warm-up tied to the square root of the
source/target size ratio, (ii) Split Batch Normalization (Split-BN) with shared
affine parameters and per-domain running statistics, and (iii) a parameter-free
logit-level Radial Basis Function kernel Maximum Mean Discrepancy (RBF-MMD)
term using the median-bandwidth heuristic. Implemented on an EEG Conformer,
AS-MMD is backbone-agnostic and leaves the inference-time model unchanged.
Across both transfer directions, it outperforms target-only and pooled training
(Active Visual Oddball: accuracy/AUC 0.66/0.74; ERP CORE P3: 0.61/0.65), with
gains over pooling significant under corrected paired t-tests. Ablations
attribute improvements to all three components.

*Maximilian Bauhofer,Marcus Henninger,Meik Kottkamp,Lucas Giroto,Philip Grill,Alexander Felix,Thorsten Wild,Stephan ten Brink,Silvio Mandelli*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该论文展示了在真实工厂环境中使用5G兼容的ISAC概念验证系统，基于PHD滤波器在距离和多普勒速度域进行多目标跟踪，取得了良好的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将跟踪技术融入蜂窝通信系统对于集成感知与通信(ISAC)应用至关重要，但现有多目标跟踪算法尚未应用于面临杂波和非理想硬件等挑战的真实ISAC场景。

Method: 使用5G兼容的ISAC概念验证系统采集测量数据，在距离和多普勒速度域应用概率假设密度(PHD)滤波器进行多目标跟踪，详细描述了从测量采集到评估的完整处理流程。

Result: 端到端评估显示，在具有挑战性的真实场景中，多目标跟踪性能良好：平均绝对误差<1.5米，检测率>91%。

Conclusion: 研究表明PHD滤波器在真实ISAC环境中能够有效实现多目标跟踪，为将跟踪技术集成到蜂窝通信系统提供了可行性验证。

Abstract: For a wide range of envisioned integrated sensing and communication (ISAC)
use cases, it is necessary to incorporate tracking techniques into cellular
communication systems. While numerous multi-object tracking algorithms exist,
they have not yet been applied to real-world ISAC, with its challenges such as
clutter and non-optimal hardware. In this work, we showcase multi-object
tracking based on the probability hypothesis density (PHD) filter in the range
and Doppler speed domain. The measurements are taken with a 5G compliant ISAC
proof-of-concept in a real factory environment, where the pedestrian-like
objects are generated by a radar object emulator. We detail the complete
pipeline, from measurement acquisition to evaluation, with a focus on the
post-processing of the raw captured data and the tracking itself. Our
end-to-end evaluation and comparison to simulations show good multi-object
tracking performance with mean absolute error <1.5m and detection rates >91%
for realistic but challenging scenarios.

### [5] [Angular Estimation Comparison with ISAC PoC](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22297)
*Alexander Felix,Rudolf Hoffmann,Marcus Henninger,Stephan ten Brink,Silvio Mandelli*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 评估基于最小DFT角度采样的角度估计方法，发现插值方法在不同角度场景中更有效，而DFT插值方法整体表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ISAC系统采用模拟或混合波束成形结构会限制角度能力，需要基于最小角度样本数实现目标角度估计和分离。

Method: 使用ISAC概念验证系统在工业场景中扫描多个波束获取最小DFT角度样本，评估不同角度估计方法。

Result: 插值方法在不同角度场景中泛化能力更强；OMP方法对单个强目标估计最准确；DFT插值方法整体性能最佳。

Conclusion: DFT插值方法在最小角度样本下的角度估计中表现最优，为ISAC用例实现提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The introduction of Integrated Sensing and Communications (ISAC) in cellular
systems is not expected to result in a shift away from the popular choice of
cost- and energy-efficient analog or hybrid beamforming structures. However,
this comes at the cost of limiting the angular capabilities to a confined space
per acquisitions. Thus, as a prerequisite for the successful implementation of
numerous ISAC use cases, the need for an optimal angular estimation of targets
and their separation based on the minimal number of angular samples arises.
  In this work, different approaches for angular estimation based on a minimal,
DFT-based set of angular samples are evaluated. The samples are acquired
through sweeping multiple beams of an ISAC proof of concept (PoC) in the
industrial scenario of the ARENA2036. The study's findings indicate that
interpolation approaches are more effective for generalizing across different
types of angular scenarios. While the orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP)
approach exhibits the most accurate estimation for a single, strong and clearly
discriminable target, the DFT-based interpolation approach demonstrates the
best overall estimation performance.

*Anargyros Michaloliakos,Benjamin J. Chang,Lawrence A. Bergman,Alexander F. Vakakis*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出基于小波变换的数据驱动模态识别和降阶建模框架，用于处理具有密集模态和非经典阻尼的机械系统，相比传统傅里叶方法能更可靠地识别密集模态并准确捕捉模态相互作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统傅里叶方法在识别密集模态和准确捕捉模态相互作用方面存在局限性，特别是在处理非经典阻尼系统时表现不佳。

Method: 利用连续小波变换(CWT)的时频分辨率优势，通过选择小波谱中的谐波区域来分离模态，然后应用逆小波变换(ICWT)重构时域模态动态，再通过希尔伯特变换提取瞬时相位构建复数模态矩阵。

Result: 该方法在数值非经典阻尼系统和飞机结构实验模型上得到验证，能够有效解析复杂模态相互作用并准确再现结构系统的动态响应。

Conclusion: 所提出的小波框架能够可靠识别密集模态，准确表征系统模态特性，即使在噪声和模态干扰等挑战性条件下也能有效工作，为复杂结构系统的模态分析和降阶建模提供了有效工具。

Abstract: This work presents a purely data-driven, wavelet-based framework for modal
identification and reduced-order modeling of mechanical systems with assumed
linear dynamics characterized by closely spaced modes with classical or
non-classical damping distribution. Traditional Fourier-based methods often
fail to reliably identify closely spaced modes or accurately capture modal
interactions and complexities. To address these limitations, we propose a
methodology leveraging the enhanced time -frequency resolution capabilities of
the continuous wavelet transform (CWT). By selecting appropriate harmonic
regions within the wavelet spectra, we effectively isolate modes, and then
invert them back in the temporal domain by applying the inverse CWT (ICWT). In
this way we reconstruct the corresponding modal dynamics in the time domain.
Using the Hilbert transform, instantaneous phases are extracted for each
identified mode, enabling the introduction of a complexified modal matrix which
robustly characterizes the system's modal properties, even under challenging
perturbations such as noise and uncertainties due to modal interference and
unmodeled effects. The identified modal parameters are utilized to reconstruct
the frequency response functions (FRFs) of the system and to develop a
reduced-order model (ROM) that captures accurately the system's dominant
dynamical behavior valid in a specified frequency range.. Validation of the
methodology is conducted both with a numerical non-classical damping and an
experimental testbed representing a model of an airplane structure. Results
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in resolving intricate
modal interactions and accurately reproducing the dynamic response of complex
structural systems.

### [7] [Genetic Optimization of a Software-Defined GNSS Receiver](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22417)
*Laura Train,Rodrigo Castellanos,Miguel Gómez-López*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出基于遗传算法的优化框架，用于自动优化GNSS接收机在高动态环境下的跟踪环路参数，解决传统接收机在高加速度场景下的性能下降问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 商用GNSS接收机在高动态条件下（如火箭发射）性能显著下降，传统跟踪环路带宽无法适应同步参数的快速变化。虽然软件定义无线电接收机具有灵活性，但手动调参复杂且难以保证最优性能。

Method: 使用遗传算法自主探索接收机配置空间，优化相位、频率和延迟跟踪的环路参数。在SDR环境中使用模拟GPS L1信号验证，涵盖火箭飞行、低地球轨道卫星和静态接收机三种动态场景。

Result: 优化后的配置在不同动态条件下均能保持稳健准确的PVT解：静态情况下最大位置和速度误差约6米和0.08米/秒；火箭情况下12米和2.5米/秒；LEO情况下5米和0.2米/秒。

Conclusion: 进化优化使SDR接收机能够在各种动态条件下保持稳健准确的定位性能，为高动态GNSS应用提供了有效的参数优化解决方案。

Abstract: Commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)
receivers face significant limitations under high-dynamic conditions,
particularly in high-acceleration environments such as those experienced by
launch vehicles. These performance degradations, often observed as
discontinuities in the navigation solution, arise from the inability of
traditional tracking loop bandwidths to cope with rapid variations in
synchronization parameters. Software-Defined Radio (SDR) receivers overcome
these constraints by enabling flexible reconfiguration of tracking loops;
however, manual tuning involves a complex, multidimensional search and seldom
ensures optimal performance. This work introduces a genetic algorithm-based
optimization framework that autonomously explores the receiver configuration
space to determine optimal loop parameters for phase, frequency, and delay
tracking. The approach is validated within an SDR environment using
realistically simulated GPS L1 signals for three representative dynamic regimes
-guided rocket flight, Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite, and static
receiver-processed with the open-source GNSS-SDR architecture. Results
demonstrate that evolutionary optimization enables SDR receivers to maintain
robust and accurate Position, Velocity, and Time (PVT) solutions across diverse
dynamic conditions. The optimized configurations yielded maximum position and
velocity errors of approximately 6 m and 0.08 m/s for the static case, 12 m and
2.5 m/s for the rocket case, and 5 m and 0.2 m/s for the LEO case.

### [8] [Data-driven Exponential Framing for Pulsive Temporal Patterns without Repetition or Singularity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22472)
*Yohei Kono,Yoshiyuki Tajima*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为数据驱动指数框架（DEF）的方法，用于从小数据集中提取无重复或奇异性的脉冲时间模式，通过时间延迟坐标和线性动态系统模型来量化模式持续时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在制造应用中，从没有重复或奇异性的小数据集中提取脉冲时间模式具有重要意义，但科学界对此关注不足。

Method: 基于时间延迟嵌入和数据驱动的Hankel矩阵分析，在时间延迟坐标上建立线性动态系统模型，推导具有不同指数衰减常数的离散时间基，通过滑动窗口提取子序列并拟合这些基来量化模式持续时间。

Result: 玩具模型实验表明DEF能识别具有不同长度的多种模式；在冲压机电流测量中的应用显示其能从真实世界振荡数据中提取多种模式。

Conclusion: DEF方法能够有效量化时间模式的持续时间，为从小数据集提取脉冲时间模式提供了可行方案，在制造应用中具有潜在价值。

Abstract: Extracting pulsive temporal patterns from a small dataset without their
repetition or singularity shows significant importance in manufacturing
applications but does not sufficiently attract scientific attention. We propose
to quantify how long temporal patterns appear without relying on their
repetition or singularity, enabling to extract such temporal patterns from a
small dataset. Inspired by the celebrated time delay embedding and data-driven
Hankel matrix analysis, we introduce a linear dynamical system model on the
time-delay coordinates behind the data to derive the discrete-time bases each
of which has a distinct exponential decay constant. The derived bases are
fitted onto subsequences that are extracted with a sliding window in order to
quantify how long patterns are dominant in the set of subsequences. We call the
quantification method Data-driven Exponential Framing (DEF). A toy model-based
experiment shows that DEF can identify multiple patterns with distinct lengths.
DEF is also applied to electric current measurement on a punching machine,
showing its possibility to extract multiple patterns from real-world
oscillatory data.

### [9] [Large-Model AI for Near Field Beam Prediction: A CNN-GPT2 Framework for 6G XL-MIMO](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22557)
*Wang Liu,Cunhua Pan,Hong Ren,Wei Zhang,Cheng-Xiang Wang,Jiangzhou Wang*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出基于CNN-GPT2的端到端近场波束预测框架，解决毫米波通信中大规模天线阵列带来的高开销和非线性动态变化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 毫米波通信中极大规模天线阵列在高速移动场景下，近场波束预测需要联合采样角度和距离域，导致导频开销急剧增加，且最优波束索引呈现非线性动态变化，传统时间建模面临挑战。

Method: 设计上行链路导频传输策略，使用宽波束模拟预编码和频率变化数字预编码进行高效信道探测；采用CNN特征提取器和GPT-2模型捕获多帧时间依赖关系，端到端预测近场波束索引。

Result: 论文未提供具体实验结果，但提出了完整的近场波束预测框架。

Conclusion: CNN-GPT2框架能够有效解决近场波束预测中的高开销和非线性动态问题，为毫米波通信中的大规模天线阵列应用提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: The emergence of extremely large-scale antenna arrays (ELAA) in
millimeter-wave (mmWave) communications, particularly in high-mobility
scenarios, highlights the importance of near-field beam prediction. Unlike the
conventional far-field assumption, near-field beam prediction requires
codebooks that jointly sample the angular and distance domains, which leads to
a dramatic increase in pilot overhead. Moreover, unlike the far-field case
where the optimal beam evolution is temporally smooth, the optimal near-field
beam index exhibits abrupt and nonlinear dynamics due to its joint dependence
on user angle and distance, posing significant challenges for temporal
modeling. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Convolutional Neural
Network-Generative Pre-trained Transformer 2 (CNN-GPT2) based near-field beam
prediction framework. Specifically, an uplink pilot transmission strategy is
designed to enable efficient channel probing through widebeam analog precoding
and frequency-varying digital precoding. The received pilot signals are
preprocessed and passed through a CNN-based feature extractor, followed by a
GPT-2 model that captures temporal dependencies across multiple frames and
directly predicts the near-field beam index in an end-to-end manner.

*Md. Shahriar Sadid,Ali A. Nasir,Saad Al-Ahmadi,Samir Al-Ghadhban*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对主动RIS的参数化信道估计方法，通过自适应MLE和正交角度对码本，用最少的导频实现近最优性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RIS受限于级联信道结构和非参数方法的高导频开销，难以获取准确的用户到RIS信道状态信息。主动RIS通过信号放大提高了实际部署的可行性

Method: 将主动RIS模型与自适应最大似然估计器结合，采用自适应主动RIS配置策略，使用正交角度对码本替代传统DFT码本

Result: 该方法用很少的导频就能实现近最优性能，在相同总功率预算下，主动RIS比传统被动RIS获得更高的频谱效率

Conclusion: 主动RIS通过消除被动RIS固有的乘性衰落并将更多资源分配给数据传输，在信道估计和频谱效率方面表现出优越性能

Abstract: Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS) technology has emerged as a key
enabler for future wireless communications. However, its potential is
constrained by the difficulty of acquiring accurate user-to-RIS channel state
information (CSI), due to the cascaded channel structure and the high pilot
overhead of non-parametric methods. Unlike a passive RIS, where the reflected
signal suffers from multiplicative path loss, an active RIS amplifies the
signal, improving its practicality in real deployments. In this letter, we
propose a parametric channel estimation method tailored for active RISs. The
proposed approach integrates an active RIS model with an adaptive Maximum
Likelihood Estimator (MLE) to recover the main channel parameters using a
minimal number of pilots. To further enhance performance, an adaptive active
RIS configuration strategy is employed, which refines the beam direction based
on an initial user location estimate. Moreover, an orthogonal angle-pair
codebook is used instead of the conventional Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT)
codebook, significantly reducing the codebook size and ensuring reliable
operation for both far-field and near-field users. Extensive simulations
demonstrate that the proposed method achieves near-optimal performance with
very few pilots compared to non-parametric approaches. Its performance is also
benchmarked against that of a traditional passive RIS under the same total
power budget to ensure fairness. Results show that active RIS yields higher
spectral efficiency (SE) by eliminating the multiplicative fading inherent in
passive RISs and allocating more resources to data transmission

*Yong Huang,Wenjing Wang,Dalong Zhang,Junjie Wang,Chen Chen,Yan Cao,Wei Wang*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: CSI2Q是一个新颖的CSI指纹识别系统，通过将频域CSI测量转换为时域信号，并采用深度辅助学习策略从IQ指纹模型转移知识，在开放世界环境中实现了与IQ方法相当的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RF指纹识别技术需要专用设备捕获IQ样本，限制了广泛应用。虽然商用WiFi设备可获取CSI，但在开放世界环境中面临CSI测量粒度粗的挑战。

Method: 首先将频域CSI测量转换为与IQ样本共享特征空间的时域信号；然后采用深度辅助学习策略从IQ指纹模型向CSI模型转移知识；最后结合OpenMax函数估计未知设备的可能性。

Result: 在包含85个设备的合成CSI数据集和分别包含10个和25个WiFi路由器的两个真实CSI数据集上测试，准确率分别提高了至少16%、20%和17%。

Conclusion: CSI2Q系统成功解决了CSI指纹识别在开放世界环境中的挑战，实现了与IQ方法相当的性能，为轻量级RF指纹识别提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Radio frequency (RF) fingerprinting techniques provide a promising supplement
to cryptography-based approaches but rely on dedicated equipment to capture
in-phase and quadrature (IQ) samples, hindering their wide adoption. Recent
advances advocate easily obtainable channel state information (CSI) by
commercial WiFi devices for lightweight RF fingerprinting, while falling short
in addressing the challenges of coarse granularity of CSI measurements in an
open-world setting. In this paper, we propose CSI2Q, a novel CSI fingerprinting
system that achieves comparable performance to IQ-based approaches. Instead of
extracting fingerprints directly from raw CSI measurements, CSI2Q first
transforms frequency-domain CSI measurements into time-domain signals that
share the same feature space with IQ samples. Then, we employ a deep auxiliary
learning strategy to transfer useful knowledge from an IQ fingerprinting model
to the CSI counterpart. Finally, the trained CSI model is combined with an
OpenMax function to estimate the likelihood of unknown ones. We evaluate CSI2Q
on one synthetic CSI dataset involving 85 devices and two real CSI datasets,
including 10 and 25 WiFi routers, respectively. Our system achieves accuracy
increases of at least 16% on the synthetic CSI dataset, 20% on the in-lab CSI
dataset, and 17% on the in-the-wild CSI dataset.

Conclusion: Neural-HAR展示了在资源受限平台上实现实时、节能的边缘推理的可行性，为雷达人体活动识别提供了高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Radar-based human activity recognition (HAR) is attractive for unobtrusive
and privacy-preserving monitoring, yet many CNN/RNN solutions remain too heavy
for edge deployment, and even lightweight ViT/SSM variants often exceed
practical compute and memory budgets. We introduce Neural-HAR, a
dimension-gated CNN accelerator tailored for real-time radar HAR on
resource-constrained platforms. At its core is GateCNN, a parameter-efficient
Doppler-temporal network that (i) embeds Doppler vectors to emphasize frequency
evolution over time and (ii) applies dual-path gated convolutions that modulate
Doppler-aware content features with temporal gates, complemented by a residual
path for stable training. On the University of Glasgow UoG2020 continuous radar
dataset, GateCNN attains 86.4% accuracy with only 2.7k parameters and 0.28M
FLOPs per inference, comparable to CNN-BiGRU at a fraction of the complexity.
Our FPGA prototype on Xilinx Zynq-7000 Z-7007S reaches 107.5 $\mu$s latency and
15 mW dynamic power using LUT-based ROM and distributed RAM only (zero
DSP/BRAM), demonstrating real-time, energy-efficient edge inference. Code and
HLS conversion scripts are available at https://github.com/lab-emi/AIRHAR.

Abstract: Modal decomposition techniques, such as Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD),
Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD), and Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA),
have advanced time-frequency signal analysis since the early 21st century.
These methods are generally classified into two categories: numerical
optimization-based methods (EMD, VMD) and spectral decomposition methods (SSA)
that consider the physical meaning of signals. The former can produce spurious
modes due to the lack of physical constraints, while the latter is more
sensitive to noise and struggles with nonlinear signals. Despite continuous
improvements in these methods, a modal decomposition approach that effectively
combines the strengths of both categories remains elusive. This paper thus
proposes a Robust Modal Decomposition (RMD) method with constrained bandwidth,
which preserves the intrinsic structure of the signal by mapping the time
series into its trajectory-GRAM matrix in phase space. Moreover, the method
incorporates bandwidth constraints during the decomposition process, enhancing
noise resistance. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets,
including millimeter-wave radar echoes, electrocardiogram (ECG),
phonocardiogram (PCG), and bearing fault detection data, demonstrate the
method's effectiveness and versatility. All code and dataset samples are

TL;DR: 开发了一种集成多模态传感器的可穿戴设备，用于上肢康复，通过低延迟AI推理提供安全辅助，在健康成人中验证了降低震颤、改善运动范围和任务完成率的技术可行性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 上肢无力和震颤限制了日常生活活动并降低了家庭康复的依从性，需要开发能够提供安全辅助的可穿戴康复设备。

Method: 采用轻量级节点集成表面肌电、惯性测量单元和弯曲/力传感器，结合设备端INT8推理（Tiny 1D-CNN/Transformer）和安全边界辅助策略（角度/扭矩/加速度限制；停滞/超时保护）。

Result: 辅助显著降低了震颤指数（-0.092），增加了运动范围（+12.65%）和每分钟重复次数（+2.99），设备端延迟中位数为8.7毫秒，所有会话均完成且无设备相关不良事件。

Conclusion: 多模态传感与低延迟、安全边界辅助在试点技术可行性环境中改善了运动质量和任务完成率，支持推进到IRB批准的患者研究。

Abstract: Background: Upper-limb weakness and tremor (4--12 Hz) limit activities of
daily living (ADL) and reduce adherence to home rehabilitation. Objective: To
assess technical feasibility and clinician-relevant signals of a sensor-fused
wearable targeting the triceps brachii and extensor pollicis brevis. Methods: A
lightweight node integrates surface EMG (1 kHz), IMU (100--200 Hz), and
flex/force sensors with on-device INT8 inference (Tiny 1D-CNN/Transformer) and
a safety-bounded assist policy (angle/torque/jerk limits; stall/time-out).
Healthy adults (n = 12) performed three ADL-like tasks. Primary outcomes:
Tremor Index (TI), range of motion (ROM), repetitions (Reps min$^{-1}$).
Secondary: EMG median-frequency slope (fatigue trend), closed-loop latency,
session completion, and device-related adverse events. Analyses used
subject-level paired medians with BCa 95\% CIs; exact Wilcoxon $p$-values are
reported in the Results. Results: Assistance was associated with lower tremor
prominence and improved task throughput: TI decreased by $-0.092$ (95\% CI
[$-0.102$, $-0.079$]), ROM increased by $+12.65\%$ (95\% CI [$+8.43$,
$+13.89$]), and Reps rose by $+2.99$ min$^{-1}$ (95\% CI [$+2.61$, $+3.35$]).
Median on-device latency was 8.7 ms at a 100 Hz loop rate; all sessions were
completed with no device-related adverse events. Conclusions: Multimodal
sensing with low-latency, safety-bounded assistance produced improved movement
quality (TI $\downarrow$) and throughput (ROM, Reps $\uparrow$) in a pilot
technical-feasibility setting, supporting progression to IRB-approved patient
studies. Trial registration: Not applicable (pilot non-clinical).

Abstract: The development of the low-altitude economy has led to a growing prominence
of uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV) safety management issues. Therefore, accurate
identification, real-time localization, and effective countermeasures have
become core challenges in airspace security assurance. This paper introduces an
integrated UAV management and control system based on deep learning, which
integrates multimodal multi-sensor fusion perception, precise positioning, and
collaborative countermeasures. By incorporating deep learning methods, the
system combines radio frequency (RF) spectral feature analysis, radar
detection, electro-optical identification, and other methods at the detection
level to achieve the identification and classification of UAVs. At the
localization level, the system relies on multi-sensor data fusion and the
air-space-ground integrated communication network to conduct real-time tracking
and prediction of UAV flight status, providing support for early warning and
decision-making. At the countermeasure level, it adopts comprehensive measures
that integrate ``soft kill'' and ``hard kill'', including technologies such as
electromagnetic signal jamming, navigation spoofing, and physical interception,
to form a closed-loop management and control process from early warning to
final disposal, which significantly enhances the response efficiency and
disposal accuracy of low-altitude UAV management.

Conclusion: PASS增强型MEC架构通过自适应上行链路波束成形，有效提高了任务卸载效率和延迟性能，特别适用于高频移动边缘计算系统。

Abstract: A pinching-antenna system (PASS)-enhanced mobile edge computing (MEC)
architecture is investigated to improve the task offloading efficiency and
latency performance in dynamic wireless environments. By leveraging dielectric
waveguides and flexibly adjustable pinching antennas, PASS establishes
short-distance line-of-sight (LoS) links while effectively mitigating the
significant path loss and potential signal blockage, making it a promising
solution for high-frequency MEC systems. We formulate a network latency
minimization problem to joint optimize uplink PASS beamforming and task
offloading. The resulting problem is modeled as a Markov decision process (MDP)
and solved via the deep reinforcement learning (DRL) method. To address the
instability introduced by the $\max$ operator in the objective function, we
propose a load balancing-aware proximal policy optimization (LBPPO) algorithm.
LBPPO incorporates both node-level and waveguide-level load balancing
information into the policy design, maintaining computational and transmission
delay equilibrium, respectively. Simulation results demonstrate that the
proposed PASS-enhanced MEC with adaptive uplink PASS beamforming exhibit
stronger convergence capability than fixed-PA baselines and conventional
MIMO-assisted MEC, especially in scenarios with a large number of UEs or high
transmit power.

Conclusion: PISAC框架有效提升了自动驾驶车辆的安全性和效率，验证了将物理层ISAC优化与运动规划相结合的价值。

Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) enables simultaneous
localization, environment perception, and data exchange for connected
autonomous vehicles. However, most existing ISAC designs prioritize sensing
accuracy and communication throughput, treating all targets uniformly and
overlooking the impact of critical obstacles on motion efficiency. To overcome
this limitation, we propose a planning-oriented ISAC (PISAC) framework that
reduces the sensing uncertainty of planning-bottleneck obstacles and expands
the safe navigable path for the ego-vehicle, thereby bridging the gap between
physical-layer optimization and motion-level planning. The core of PISAC lies
in deriving a closed-form safety bound that explicitly links ISAC transmit
power to sensing uncertainty, based on the Cram\'er-Rao Bound and occupancy
inflation principles. Using this model, we formulate a bilevel power allocation
and motion planning (PAMP) problem, where the inner layer optimizes the ISAC
beam power distribution and the outer layer computes a collision-free
trajectory under uncertainty-aware safety constraints. Comprehensive
simulations in high-fidelity urban driving environments demonstrate that PISAC
achieves up to 40% higher success rates and over 5% shorter traversal times
than existing ISAC-based and communication-oriented benchmarks, validating its
effectiveness in enhancing both safety and efficiency.

Motivation: 解决未来大规模机器通信场景中对大规模连接和低接入延迟的迫切需求，传统正交多址接入方案在无协调随机接入中效率较低。

Method: 将经典的时隙ALOHA协议与稀疏码多址接入技术结合，用户随机选择SCMA码本在任意时隙接入网络，采用干扰消除优先的解码策略，并引入用户阻挡机制管理流量负载。

Conclusion: SCMA-empowered URA方案通过干扰消除解码和自适应流量管理，显著提升了无协调随机接入系统的性能，适用于大规模机器通信场景。

Abstract: In this paper, a novel uncoordinated random access (URA) protocol is
presented to address the pressing demand for massive connectivity with low
access latency in future massive machine type communication (mMTC) scenarios.
The proposed URA scheme integrates the classical slotted ALOHA (S-ALOHA)
protocol with sparse code multiple access (SCMA) technique, referred to as
SCMA-empowered URA. Specifically, active users randomly choose an SCMA codebook
to access the communication network in an arbitrary time slot whenever they
want without scheduling. However, due to the lack of central coordination in
the proposed URA scheme, SCMA codebook collisions become inevitable, making
decoding challenging and leading to increased access failures. To cope with the
decoding issue, an interference-canceling (IC) first decoding strategy is
proposed at the access point (AP), which can partially tackles collision
problems, contributing to a higher system throughput. Taking the proposed
IC-first decoding strategy into account, a closed-form theoretical expression
of the throughput is derived. Moreover, to alleviate the throughput degradation
under the congested user traffic, a user barring mechanism is introduced to
manage the traffic load. Firstly, a closed-form expression of idle codebook
probability is developed to help indicate the system state, i.e., congested or
not. Then, in addition to the estimated real-time load, the AP adaptively
adjusts the access probability and redistributes the actual access load.
Finally, simulation results demonstrate that the proposed SCMA-empowered URA
scheme enjoys higher maximum throughput, compared to the conventional
orthogonal multiple access (OMA) based URA scheme. Moreover, the accuracy of
the presented theoretical analysis and the effectiveness of the user barring
mechanism are verified.

Abstract: Stacked intelligent metasurfaces (SIMs) represent a key enabler for
next-generation wireless networks, offering beamforming gains while
significantly reducing radio-frequency chain requirements. In conventional
space-only SIM architectures, the rate of reconfigurability of the SIM is equal
to the inverse of the channel coherence time. This paper investigates a novel
beamforming strategy for massive downlink connectivity using a randomized
space-time (ST) coded SIM. In addition to conventional space-only metasurface
layers, the proposed design integrates a ST metasurface layer at the input
stage of the SIM that introduces random time variations over each channel
coherence time interval. These artificial time variations enable opportunistic
user scheduling and exploitation of multiuser diversity under slow channel
dynamics. To mitigate the prohibitive overhead associated with full channel
state information at the transmitter (CSIT), we propose a partial-CSIT-based
beamforming scheme that leverages randomized steering vectors and limited
user-side feedback based on signal quality measurements. Numerical results
demonstrate that the proposed ST-SIM architecture achieves satisfactory
sum-rate performance while significantly reducing CSIT acquisition and feedback
overhead, thereby enabling scalable downlink connectivity in dense networks.

Motivation: 传统TDD方案中上下行传输需要正交时隙，频谱效率受限。为提升频谱利用率，需要开发能够同时支持上下行传输的新框架。

Conclusion: 夹持天线系统框架能够有效实现同时同频的上下行传输，通过联合优化天线激活和功率分配，大幅提升了系统性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we explore a novel joint uplink and downlink framework
utilizing a pinching antenna system (PASS). We consider two waveguides, one
dedicated to transmission and one to reception, and both of them are connected
to a base station (BS). Each type of waveguide consists of several pinching
antennas (PAs) in some preconfigured positions. In this framework, we assume
the BS can serve downlink and uplink user equipments (UEs) at the same time
using the same spectrum resources through the presented PASS. In this aspect,
we formulate a sum rate optimization problem that jointly optimizes the antenna
activation factor, the BS transmit power, and the UE's transmit power, subject
to power budget constraints for the BS and the UEs, as well as minimum rate
requirements for the UEs. The formulated problem is highly non-convex and
difficult to solve directly. Hence, we divide the main problem into two
sub-problems: the antenna activation sub-problem and the power allocation
sub-problem. Then, we solve the antenna activation problem utilizing a distance
and spatial correlation-based algorithm. Meanwhile, the resource allocation
problem is solved using a successive convex approximation (SCA)-based
algorithm. Numerical results show that our proposed framework can achieve
around 60-90\% performance gains over its time division duplex (TDD) where the
uplink and downlink transmissions are served in different orthogonal time
slots.

Motivation: 编码缓存技术通过子分组化创建编码多播机会来降低传输负载，但过高的子分组化水平会导致编码复杂度增加。现有研究缺乏对固定子分组化水平下最小传输负载的深入理解。

Method: 通过重新构建集中式编码缓存方案的组合结构（放置交付数组），提出传输负载的通用下界，并利用组合结构和排序集合并集计算来建立新的最优性结果。

Result: 建立了传输负载与子分组化水平之间的基本权衡关系，证明了分区方案能够达到最优的速率-子分组化权衡，并恢复了现有最优方案的结果。

Conclusion: 本文为编码缓存系统提供了传输负载与子分组化水平之间的基本理论界限，证明了分区方案的最优性，为实际系统设计提供了理论指导。

Abstract: Coded caching is a promising technique to create coded multicast
opportunities for cache-aided networks. By splitting each file into $F$ equal
packets (i.e., the subpacketization level $F$) and letting each user cache a
set of packets, the transmission load can be significantly reduced via coded
multicasting. It has been shown that a higher subpacketization level could
potentially lead to a lower transmission load, as more packets can be combined
for efficient transmission. On the other hand, a larger $F$ indicates a higher
coding complexity and is problematic from a practical perspective when $F$ is
extremely large. Despite many works attempting to design coded caching schemes
with low subpacketization levels, a fundamental problem remains open: What is
the minimum transmission load given any fixed subpacketization level? In this
paper, we consider the classical cache-aided networks with identically uncoded
placement and one-shot delivery strategy, and investigate the fundamental
trade-off between the transmission load and the subpacketization level. We
propose a \emph{general} lower bound on the transmission load for any fixed
subpacketization by reformulating the centralized coded caching schemes via the
combinatorial structure of the corresponding placement delivery array. The
lower bound also recovers existing optimality results for the bipartite graph
scheme (including the well-known Maddah-Ali and Niesen (MN) scheme and the
conjugate MN scheme) as well as the grouping bipartite graph scheme.
Furthermore, by carefully exploiting the combinatorial structure and computing
the union size of sorted sets, we establish a new optimality result, i.e., the
partition scheme can achieve the optimal rate-subpacketization trade-off.

Abstract: Channel estimation for massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems
is fundamentally constrained by excessive pilot overhead and high estimation
latency. To overcome these obstacles, recent studies have leveraged deep
generative networks to capture the prior distribution of wireless channels. In
this paper, we propose a novel estimation framework that integrates an
energy-based generative diffusion model (DM) with the Metropolis-Hastings (MH)
principle. By reparameterizing the diffusion process with an incorporated
energy function, the framework explicitly estimates the unnormalized log-prior,
while MH corrections refine the sampling trajectory, mitigate deviations, and
enhance robustness, ultimately enabling accurate posterior sampling for
high-fidelity channel estimation. Numerical results reveal that the proposed
approach significantly improves estimation accuracy compared with conventional
parameterized DMs and other baseline methods, particularly in cases with
limited pilot overhead.

Abstract: R. W. Hamming published the Hamming codes and the sphere packing bound in
1950. In the past 75 years, infinite families of distance-optimal linear codes
over finite fields with minimum distance at most 8 with respect to the sphere
packing bound have been reported in the literature. However, it is a
75-year-old open problem in coding theory whether there is an infinite family

minimum distance with respect to the sphere packing bound. This main objective
of this paper is to settle this long-standing open problem in coding theory.
  As by-products, several infinite families of distance-optimal binary codes
with small minimum distances are presented. Two infinite families of binary
five-weight codes are reported. Some open problems are also proposed.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了分布式传感器网络中异步相关信息的融合估计问题，建立了采样、调度和估计的联合最优策略，并证明了在相关传感环境下信息新鲜度可作为最优估计的设计替代指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在分布式传感器网络中，传感器观测到重叠区域的动态过程，但由于随机延迟，这些相关观测异步到达融合中心，需要解决如何融合异步但相关信息以实现准确远程融合估计的问题。

Method: 通过研究相关维纳过程监控的采样、调度和估计策略的联合设计，建立了分离原理，确定了联合最优策略：最优融合估计器是基于信息年龄(AoI)的加权和融合估计器，最优调度器是优先处理最陈旧源的最大年龄优先(MAF)调度器，最优采样可在给定最优估计器和MAF调度器的情况下设计。

Result: 在无限时域平均成本准则下，优化AoI等价于在基于拉取通信下优化MSE，尽管存在强传感器间相关性。这种结构等价性使得MSE最优采样器也是AoI最优采样器。

Conclusion: 信息新鲜度可以作为相关传感环境中最优估计的设计替代指标，这一发现为分布式传感器网络中的异步信息融合提供了重要理论依据。

Abstract: In distributed sensor networks, sensors often observe a dynamic process
within overlapping regions. Due to random delays, these correlated observations
arrive at the fusion center asynchronously, raising a central question: How can
one fuse asynchronous yet correlated information for accurate remote fusion
estimation? This paper addresses this challenge by studying the joint design of
sampling, scheduling, and estimation policies for monitoring a correlated
Wiener process. Though this problem is coupled, we establish a separation
principle and identify the joint optimal policy: the optimal fusion estimator
is a weighted-sum fusion estimator conditioned on Age of Information (AoI), the
optimal scheduler is a Maximum Age First (MAF) scheduler that prioritizes the
most stale source, and the optimal sampling can be designed given the optimal
estimator and the MAF scheduler. To design the optimal sampling, we show that,
under the infinite-horizon average-cost criterion, optimizing AoI is equivalent
to optimizing MSE under pull-based communications, despite the presence of
strong inter-sensor correlations. This structural equivalence allows us to
identify the MSE-optimal sampler as one that is AoI-optimal. This result
underscores an insight: information freshness can serve as a design surrogate
for optimal estimation in correlated sensing environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无人机移动边缘计算系统可以采用不同多址方案协调多用户任务卸载，但尚不清楚哪种方案在有限块长度下最节能，需要系统比较NOMA、FDMA和TDMA的能耗性能。

Method: 通过理论分析三种方案的最小能耗需求，提出交替优化算法联合优化任务卸载比例、所有用户设备的卸载时间和无人机位置，解决能耗最小化问题。

Result: 理论分析表明：TDMA在无限和有限块长度情况下能耗始终低于FDMA；在有限块长度下，当两个用户设备的信道条件和任务数据大小相对对称时，NOMA不一定比FDMA更节能。仿真验证了分析结果。

Conclusion: TDMA是无人机移动边缘计算系统中最节能的多址方案，提出的交替优化算法能有效降低MEC相关能耗，为实际系统设计提供了重要指导。

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled mobile edge computing (MEC) systems can
use different multiple access schemes to coordinate multi-user task offloading.
However, it is still unknown which scheme is the most energy-efficient,
especially when the offloading blocklength is finite. To answer this question,
this paper minimizes and compares the MEC-related energy consumption of
non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), frequency division multiple access
(FDMA), and time division multiple access (TDMA)-based offloading schemes
within UAV-enabled MEC systems, considering both infinite and finite
blocklength scenarios. Through theoretically analysis of the minimum energy
consumption required by these three schemes, two novel findings are presented.
First, TDMA consistently achieves lower energy consumption than FDMA in both
infinite and finite blocklength cases, due to the degrees of freedom afforded
by sequential task offloading. Second, NOMA does not necessarily achieve lower
energy consumption than FDMA when the offloading blocklength is finite,
especially when the channel conditions and the offloaded task data sizes of two
user equipments (UEs) are relatively symmetric. Furthermore, an alternating
optimization algorithm that jointly optimizes the portions of task offloaded,
the offloading times of all UEs, and the UAV location is proposed to solve the
formulated energy consumption minimization problems. Simulation results verify
the correctness of our analytical findings and demonstrate that the proposed
algorithm effectively reduces MEC-related energy consumption compared to
benchmark schemes that do not optimize task offloading portions and/or
offloading times.

Abstract: Future immersive XR applications will require energy-efficient, high data
rate, and low-latency wireless communications in uplink and downlink. One of
the key considerations for supporting such XR applications is intelligent and
adaptive resource allocation with edge offloading. To address these demands,
this paper proposes a reinforcement learning-based resource allocation
framework that dynamically allocates uplink and downlink slots while making
offloading decisions based on the XR headset's capabilities and network
conditions. The paper presents a numerical analysis of the tradeoff between
frame loss rate (FLR) and energy efficiency, identifying decision regions for
partial offloading to optimize performance. Results show that for the used set
of system parameters, partial offloading can extend the coverage area by 55%
and reduce energy consumption by up to 34%, compared to always or never
offloading. The results demonstrate that the headset's local computing
capability plays a crucial role in offloading decisions. Higher computing
abilities enable more efficient local processing, reduce the need for
offloading, and enhance energy savings.

Motivation: 传统APSK和QAM星座的性能有限，需要开发更有效的星座成形方法来提升通信系统的误码率性能。

Method: 使用端到端学习方法，通过成形编码器产生零概率较高的成形比特，联合优化符号概率分布和星座几何形状，并扩展到包含完整迭代检测和解码循环的深度展开技术。

Result: 学习到的星座相比标准APSK或QAM，在两种接收器下分别获得最大0.3dB和0.15dB的BER增益；在块衰落信道条件下，迭代方案相比标准APSK获得0.1dB的BER增益。

Conclusion: 端到端学习方法能够有效优化星座成形，在多种接收器架构和信道条件下都能获得显著的误码率性能提升。

Abstract: An end-to-end learning method for constellation shaping with a
shaping-encoder assisted transceiver architecture is presented. The shaping
encoder, which produces shaping bits with a higher probability of zeros, is
used to produce an efficient symbol probability distribution. Both the
probability distribution and the constellation geometry are jointly optimized,
using end-to-end learning. Optimized constellations are evaluated using two
iterative receiver architectures. Bit error rate (BER) performance gain is
quantified against standard amplitude phase-shift keying (APSK) and quadrature
amplitude modulation (QAM) constellations. A maximum BER gain of 0.3 dB and
0.15 dB are observed under two receivers for the learned constellations
compared to standard APSK or QAM. The basic approach is extended to incorporate
the full iterative detection and decoding loop, using the deep unfolding
technique. A bit error rate gain of 0.1 dB is observed for the iterative scheme
with learned constellations under block fading channel conditions, when
compared to standard APSK.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在CDS问题中，Alice和Bob需要在满足特定函数关系时向Carol安全地披露秘密，同时防止在不合格输入组合下泄露秘密。研究目标是确定噪声容量，即能够安全披露给Carol的最大秘密比特数与Alice和Bob共同持有的独立噪声比特总数之比。

Method: 建立了CDS噪声容量达到最大值1的充要条件，并推导了线性噪声容量的上界，该上界表示为(ρ-1)(d-1)/(ρd-1)，其中ρ是函数f图表示的覆盖参数，d是位于不合格路径中的不合格边数。

Conclusion: 本文为CDS问题的噪声容量提供了理论分析框架，明确了最优噪声容量的条件，并给出了线性情况下的容量上界，对理解CDS协议的信息理论极限具有重要意义。

Abstract: In the problem of conditional disclosure of secrets (CDS), two parties, Alice
and Bob, each has an input and shares a common secret. Their goal is to reveal
the secret to a third party, Carol, as efficiently as possible, only if the
inputs of Alice and Bob satisfy a certain functional relation $f $. To prevent
leakage of the secret to Carol when the input combination is unqualified, both
Alice and Bob introduce noise. This work aims to determine the noise capacity,
defined as the maximum number of secret bits that can be securely revealed to
Carol, normalized by the total number of independent noise bits held jointly by
Alice and Bob. Our contributions are twofold. First, we establish the necessary
and sufficient conditions under which the CDS noise capacity attains its
maximum value of $1$. Second, in addition to the above best-case scenarios, we
derive an upper bound on the linear noise capacity for any CDS instance. In
particular, this upper bound is equal to $(\rho-1)(d-1)/(\rho d-1)$, where
$\rho$ is the covering parameter of the graph representation of $f$, and $d$ is
the number of unqualified edges in residing unqualified path.

Motivation: 高斯泼溅(GS)在低成本设备上渲染质量下降，需要一种既能保证实时性又能保证保真度的解决方案。

Method: 提出边缘协作GS(ECO-GS)框架，结合集成渲染与通信(IRAC)方法，使用惩罚主化最小化(PMM)算法和模仿学习优化(ILO)算法来联合优化协作状态和边缘功率分配。

Result: PMM算法能获得临界点解，ILO算法相比PMM计算时间减少100倍以上，实验证明了PMM的优越性和ILO的实时执行能力。

Conclusion: ECO-GS框架通过智能切换本地和远程GS模型，在通信约束下有效平衡了渲染质量和实时性需求，ILO算法实现了实时优化。

Abstract: Gaussian splatting (GS) struggles with degraded rendering quality on low-cost
devices. To address this issue, we present edge collaborative GS (ECO-GS),
where each user can switch between a local small GS model to guarantee
timeliness and a remote large GS model to guarantee fidelity. However, deciding
how to engage the large GS model is nontrivial, due to the interdependency
between rendering requirements and resource conditions. To this end, we propose
integrated rendering and communication (IRAC), which jointly optimizes
collaboration status (i.e., deciding whether to engage large GS) and edge power
allocation (i.e., enabling remote rendering) under communication constraints
across different users by minimizing a newly-derived GS switching function.
Despite the nonconvexity of the problem, we propose an efficient penalty
majorization minimization (PMM) algorithm to obtain the critical point
solution. Furthermore, we develop an imitation learning optimization (ILO)
algorithm, which reduces the computational time by over 100x compared to PMM.
Experiments demonstrate the superiority of PMM and the real-time execution
capability of ILO.

Abstract: The polar codes introduced by Arikan in 2009 achieve the capacity of
binary-input discrete memoryless channels (BIDMCs) with low complexity encoding
and decoding. Identifying the unreliable synthetic channels, generated by
Arikan transformation during the construction of these polar codes, is crucial.
Currently, because of the large size of the output alphabets of synthetic
channels, there is no efficient and practical approach to evaluate their
reliability in general. To tackle this problem, by converting the generation of
synthetic channels in polar code construction into algebraic operations, in
this paper we develop a method to characterize the synthetic channels as random
switching channels of binary symmetric channels when the underlying channels
are symmetric. Moreover, a lower bound for the average number of elements that
possess the same likelihood ratio within the output alphabet of any synthetic
channel generated in polar codes is also derived.

Abstract: The information fusion field has recently been attracting a lot of interest
within the scientific community, as it provides, through the combination of
different sources of heterogeneous information, a fuller and/or more precise
understanding of the real world than can be gained considering the above
sources separately. One of the fundamental aims of computer systems, and
especially decision support systems, is to assure that the quality of the
information they process is high. There are many different approaches for this
purpose, including information fusion. Information fusion is currently one of
the most promising methods. It is particularly useful under circumstances where
quality might be compromised, for example, either intrinsically due to
imperfect information (vagueness, uncertainty) or because of limited resources
(energy, time). In response to this goal, a wide range of research has been
undertaken over recent years. To date, the literature reviews in this field
have focused on problem-specific issues and have been circumscribed to certain
system types. Therefore, there is no holistic and systematic knowledge of the
state of the art to help establish the steps to be taken in the future. In
particular, aspects like what impact different information fusion methods have
on information quality, how information quality is characterised, measured and
evaluated in different application domains depending on the problem data type
or whether fusion is designed as a flexible process capable of adapting to
changing system circumstances and their intrinsically limited resources have
not been addressed. This paper aims precisely to review the literature on
research into the use of information fusion techniques specifically to improve
information quality, analysing the above issues in order to identify a series
of challenges and research directions, which are presented in this paper.

Motivation: 无线网络中的联邦学习受到不可预测信道条件导致的拖后腿延迟限制，需要从物理层根源解决这一问题。

Method: 使用夹持天线系统动态调整天线长度，结合物理层感知采样和误差反馈压缩技术。

Result: PASS在同步联邦学习中缩短了最差链路距离，在异步联邦学习中提高了按时完成概率，显著减少了延迟尾部和加速了训练过程。

Conclusion: 通过从物理层根源解决拖后腿问题，PASS能够补充更高层的调度策略，在同步和异步联邦学习中都能加速无线联邦学习。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) in wireless networks is limited by straggler delays
from unpredictable channel conditions. In this paper, we investigate the
pinching-antenna system (PASS), which dynamically 'pinches' the radiator along
a dielectric waveguide to shorten the worst links. In synchronous FL (SFL), we
prove that PASS shortens the worst-link distance, and it increases the on-time
completion probability in asynchronous FL (AFL). Accordingly, SFL exhibits
stochastic dominance on round time, while AFL yields explicit latency and
participation gains. We then pair physical-layer (PHY)-aware sampling with
error-feedback compression and prove that pinching raises the minimum inclusion
probability, thus shrinking both the sampling variability and
compression-induced floors in a Lyapunov analysis. Simulations demonstrate
consistent wall clock speedups and markedly shorter latency tails. By
addressing stragglers at their PHY root, PASS complements higher-layer
scheduling and accelerates wireless FL in both SFL and AFL.

construction achieves the smallest repair bandwidth among all existing
constructions with the same parameters, and is asymptotically optimal with
respect to the lower bound on the average repair bandwidth characterized by
Zhang et al. The second construction supports two repair mechanisms, depending
on whether computation within the helper nodes is permitted or not during the
node repair process, thereby optimizing either the repair bandwidth or the
rebuilding access.
