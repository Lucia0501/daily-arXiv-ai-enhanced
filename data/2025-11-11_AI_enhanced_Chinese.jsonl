Traditional modeling methods like ray tracing are however computationally demanding and unsuited to model dynamic conditions. In this paper, we propose AIRMap, a deep-learning framework for ultra-fast radio-map estimation, along with an automated pipeline for creating the largest radio-map dataset to date. AIRMap uses a single-input U-Net autoencoder that processes only a 2D elevation map of terrain and building heights. Trained and evaluated on 60,000 Boston-area samples, spanning coverage areas from 500 m to 3 km per side, AIRMap predicts path gain with under 5 dB RMSE in 4 ms per inference on an NVIDIA L40S -over 7000x faster than GPU-accelerated ray tracing based radio maps. A lightweight transfer learning calibration using just 20% of field measurements reduces the median error to approximately 10%, significantly outperforming traditional simulators, which exceed 50% error. Integration into the Colosseum emulator and the Sionna SYS platform demonstrate near-zero error in spectral efficiency and block-error rate compared to measurement-based channels. These findings validate AIRMap's potential for scalable, accurate, and real-time radio map estimation in wireless digital twins.", "AI": {"tldr": "AIRMap\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u8d85\u5feb\u901f\u65e0\u7ebf\u7535\u5730\u56fe\u4f30\u8ba1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ec5\u4f7f\u75282D\u5730\u5f62\u9ad8\u7a0b\u56fe\u5c31\u80fd\u57284\u6beb\u79d2\u5185\u9884\u6d4b\u8def\u5f84\u589e\u76ca\uff0c\u6bd4GPU\u52a0\u901f\u7684\u5c04\u7ebf\u8ffd\u8e2a\u5feb7000\u500d\u4ee5\u4e0a\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5c04\u7ebf\u8ffd\u8e2a\u65b9\u6cd5\u8ba1\u7b97\u91cf\u5927\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6ee1\u8db3\u52a8\u6001\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u65e0\u7ebf\u7f51\u7edc\u4eff\u771f\u548c\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u5e94\u7528\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528U-Net\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5904\u74062D\u5730\u5f62\u548c\u5efa\u7b51\u9ad8\u5ea6\u56fe\uff0c\u901a\u8fc76\u4e07\u4e2a\u6ce2\u58eb\u987f\u5730\u533a\u6837\u672c\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u6821\u51c6\u3002", "result": "\u9884\u6d4b\u8def\u5f84\u589e\u76ca\u7684RMSE\u4f4e\u4e8e5dB\uff0c\u4ec5\u752820%\u7684\u73b0\u573a\u6d4b\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u6821\u51c6\u540e\uff0c\u4e2d\u4f4d\u8bef\u5dee\u964d\u81f3\u7ea610%\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u768450%\u4ee5\u4e0a\u8bef\u5dee\u3002", "conclusion": "AIRMap\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5728\u65e0\u7ebf\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u51c6\u786e\u548c\u5b9e\u65f6\u65e0\u7ebf\u7535\u5730\u56fe\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

The information-theoretic upper bound on the download efficiency of these PIR schemes has been proved in previous studies.

Timely and accurate diagnosis is essential for effective intervention. Electroencephalography (EEG) provides a non-invasive and accessible method for examining cerebral activity and identifying disease-associated patterns. We propose a novel graph-based deep learning framework, named Edge-gated, axis-mixed Pooling Attention Network (ExPANet), for differentiating major depressive disorder (MDD) patients from healthy controls (HC). EEG recordings undergo preprocessing to eliminate artifacts and are segmented into short periods of activity. We extract 14 features from each segment, which include time, frequency, fractal, and complexity domains. Electrodes are represented as nodes, whereas edges are determined by the phase-locking value (PLV) to represent functional connectivity. The generated brain graphs are examined utilizing an adapted graph attention network. This architecture acquires both localized electrode characteristics and comprehensive functional connectivity patterns. The proposed framework attains superior performance relative to current EEG-based approaches across two different datasets. A fundamental advantage of our methodology is its explainability. We evaluated the significance of features, channels, and edges, in addition to intrinsic attention weights. These studies highlight features, cerebral areas, and connectivity associations that are especially relevant to MDD, many of which correspond with clinical data.

Then the LCE problem is shown to be equivalent to an algebra isomorphism problem for the doubling $R/\\mathfrak{J}_{\\mathbb{X}}$.

Moreover, for indecomposable iso-dual codes we can reduce the LCE search problem to the PI search problem of degree 3 by noting that the corresponding point sets are self-associated and arithmetically Gorenstein, so that we can use the isomorphism problem for the Artinian reductions of the coordinate rings and form their Macaulay inverse systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u8bc1\u660e\u7ebf\u6027\u7801\u7b49\u4ef7\u95ee\u9898\u7b49\u4ef7\u4e8e\u70b9\u96c6\u7b49\u4ef7\u95ee\u9898\u548c\u4ee3\u6570\u540c\u6784\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7Macaulay\u9006\u7cfb\u7edf\u5c06\u5176\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u540c\u6784\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u53ef\u5728\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u5185\u89e3\u51b3\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ebf\u6027\u7801\u7b49\u4ef7\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u5176\u4e0e\u5176\u4ed6\u6570\u5b66\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u7b49\u4ef7\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u4ee5\u5bfb\u627e\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u7ebf\u6027\u7801\u7b49\u4ef7\u95ee\u9898\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u70b9\u96c6\u7b49\u4ef7\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u518d\u901a\u8fc7\u9f50\u6b21\u5750\u6807\u73af\u548c\u5178\u8303\u7406\u60f3\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u4ee3\u6570\u540c\u6784\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u5229\u7528Macaulay\u9006\u7cfb\u7edf\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u540c\u6784\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u7ebf\u6027\u7801\u7b49\u4ef7\u95ee\u9898\u4e0e\u70b9\u96c6\u7b49\u4ef7\u95ee\u9898\u3001\u4ee3\u6570\u540c\u6784\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u7b49\u4ef7\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e86\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u53ef\u89e3\u7684\u8f6c\u5316\u8def\u5f84\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ebf\u6027\u7801\u7b49\u4ef7\u95ee\u9898\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u6570\u5b66\u8f6c\u5316\u7b80\u5316\u4e3a\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u540c\u6784\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u5176\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\u548c\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Dimensional groups, or $\u03c0-$groups, allow for the reduction of the number of parameters affecting the dimensionless measured quantities.\n  In many real-world applications, the main interest is in estimating only a subset of the variables affecting the measurements. An example is estimating the thickness and electrical conductivity of a plate from Eddy Current Testing data, regardless of the lift-off of the probe, which may be either uncertain and/or variable. Alternatively, one may seek to estimate thickness and lift-off while neglecting the influence of the electrical conductivity, or to estimate the electrical conductivity and the lift-off, neglecting the thickness.\n  This is where the concept of invariants becomes crucial. An invariant transformation is a mathematical mapping that makes the measured signal independent of one or more of these uncertain parameters. Invariant transformations provide a way to isolate useful signals from uncertain ones, improving the accuracy and reliability of the NdT results.\n  The main contribution of this paper is a systematic method to derive \\emph{invariant} transformations for frequency domain Eddy Current Testing data, via dimensional analysis. The proposed method is compatible with real-time and in-line operations.\n  After its theoretical foundation is introduced, the method is validated by means of experimental data, with reference to configurations consisting of plates with different thicknesses, electrical conductivity, and lift-off. The experimental validation proves the effectiveness of the method in achieving excellent accuracy on a wide range of parameters of interest.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u91cf\u7eb2\u5206\u6790\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u63a8\u5bfc\u6da1\u6d41\u68c0\u6d4b\u9891\u57df\u6570\u636e\u7684\u4e0d\u53d8\u53d8\u6362\uff0c\u4ee5\u9694\u79bb\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u65e0\u635f\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u65e0\u635f\u68c0\u6d4b\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\uff0c\u901a\u5e38\u53ea\u9700\u8981\u4f30\u8ba1\u5f71\u54cd\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\u53d8\u91cf\u5b50\u96c6\uff0c\u800c\u5176\u4ed6\u53c2\u6570\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6216\u53d8\u5316\u3002\u4f8b\u5982\u5728\u6da1\u6d41\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u9700\u8981\u4f30\u8ba1\u677f\u539a\u548c\u7535\u5bfc\u7387\u800c\u4e0d\u8003\u8651\u63a2\u5934\u63d0\u79bb\uff0c\u6216\u4f30\u8ba1\u63d0\u79bb\u548c\u7535\u5bfc\u7387\u800c\u4e0d\u8003\u8651\u539a\u5ea6\u3002\u4e0d\u53d8\u53d8\u6362\u80fd\u591f\u4f7f\u6d4b\u91cf\u4fe1\u53f7\u72ec\u7acb\u4e8e\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u53c2\u6570\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u91cf\u7eb2\u5206\u6790\u548c\u767d\u91d1\u6c49\u03c0\u5b9a\u7406\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u6da1\u6d41\u68c0\u6d4b\u9891\u57df\u6570\u636e\u7684\u4e0d\u53d8\u53d8\u6362\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0e\u5b9e\u65f6\u548c\u5728\u7ebf\u64cd\u4f5c\u517c\u5bb9\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u65e0\u91cf\u7eb2\u7fa4\u51cf\u5c11\u5f71\u54cd\u6d4b\u91cf\u91cf\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u6570\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0d\u540c\u539a\u5ea6\u3001\u7535\u5bfc\u7387\u548c\u63d0\u79bb\u7684\u677f\u914d\u7f6e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6570\u636e\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5173\u6ce8\u53c2\u6570\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4f18\u5f02\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u91cf\u7eb2\u5206\u6790\u7684\u4e0d\u53d8\u53d8\u6362\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u591a\u53c2\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u9694\u79bb\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u6da1\u6d41\u68c0\u6d4b\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002"}}

The first research community focuses on multimodal sensing of PD-related biomarkers using noninvasive technologies such as inertial measurement units (IMUs), force/pressure insoles, electromyography (EMG), electroencephalography (EEG), speech and acoustic analysis, and RGB/RGB-D motion capture systems. These studies emphasize data acquisition, feature extraction, and machine learning-based classification for PD screening, diagnosis, and disease progression modeling. In parallel, a second research community has concentrated on robotic intervention and rehabilitation, employing socially assistive robots (SARs), robot-assisted rehabilitation (RAR) systems, and virtual reality (VR)-integrated robotic platforms for improving motor and cognitive function, enhancing social engagement, and supporting caregivers. Despite the complementary goals of these two domains, their methodological and technological integration remains limited, with minimal data-level or decision-level coupling between the two. With the advent of advanced artificial intelligence (AI), including large language models (LLMs), agentic AI systems, a unique opportunity now exists to unify these research streams. We envision a closed-loop sensor-AI-robot framework in which multimodal sensing continuously guides the interaction between the patient, caregiver, humanoid robot (and physician) through AI agents that are powered by a multitude of AI models such as robotic and wearables foundation models, LLM-based reasoning, reinforcement learning, and continual learning. Such closed-loop system enables personalized, explainable, and context-aware intervention, forming the basis for digital twin of the PD patient that can adapt over time to deliver intelligent, patient-centered PD care.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u5c06\u5e15\u91d1\u68ee\u75c5\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u4e24\u4e2a\u72ec\u7acb\u9886\u57df\u2014\u2014\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4f20\u611f\u76d1\u6d4b\u548c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5e72\u9884\u5eb7\u590d\u2014\u2014\u901a\u8fc7\u5148\u8fdbAI\u6280\u672f\u6574\u5408\u6210\u95ed\u73af\u7684\u4f20\u611f\u5668-AI-\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u62a4\u7406\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5e15\u91d1\u68ee\u75c5\u7814\u7a76\u5b58\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u72ec\u7acb\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\uff1a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4f20\u611f\u76d1\u6d4b\u548c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5e72\u9884\u5eb7\u590d\uff0c\u4e24\u8005\u5728\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u6280\u672f\u4e0a\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6574\u5408\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5f62\u6210\u534f\u540c\u6548\u5e94\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u95ed\u73af\u4f20\u611f\u5668-AI-\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u667a\u80fd\u4ee3\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u3001\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u7b49\u591a\u79cdAI\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4f20\u611f\u4e0e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5e72\u9884\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u878d\u5408\u3002", "result": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u80fd\u591f\u6301\u7eed\u6307\u5bfc\u60a3\u8005\u3001\u62a4\u7406\u4eba\u5458\u3001\u4eba\u5f62\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u548c\u533b\u751f\u4e4b\u95f4\u4e92\u52a8\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u5e15\u91d1\u68ee\u75c5\u60a3\u8005\u7684\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7AI\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u95ed\u73af\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ef\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u4e14\u60c5\u5883\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u5e72\u9884\uff0c\u4e3a\u667a\u80fd\u5316\u7684\u5e15\u91d1\u68ee\u75c5\u62a4\u7406\u5960\u5b9a\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

While beamfocusing has been theoretically established as a key feature of large-aperture RISs, its practical realization has remained unexplored. We derive new analytical expressions for the array gain achieved with a $b$-bit RIS in near-field line-of-sight scenarios, characterizing both the finite depth and angular width of the focal region. The theoretical results are validated through a series of measurements in an indoor office environment at 28 GHz using a one-bit 1024-element RIS. The experiments confirm that near-field beamfocusing can be dynamically achieved and accurately predicted by the proposed analytical model, despite the presence of hardware imperfections and multipath propagation.

In this work, we propose an online learning framework that enables rapid low-complexity adaptation of DNN-based receivers. Our approach is based on two main tenets. First, we cast online learning as Bayesian tracking in parameter space, enabling a single-step adaptation, which deviates from multi-epoch SGD . Second, we focus on modular DNN architectures that enable parallel, online, and localized variational Bayesian updates.

Based on this, we construct a semantic distortion metric, centered on the Jensen-Shannon divergence. We then establish the core theoretical boundaries of the framework: sample complexity bounds; rate-distortion bounds; an end-to-end Service Level Agreements theorem; and a semantic source-channel separation theorem, which provides a provable Quality of Service guarantee.

In this work, we study LEO-based positioning under orbital errors within a signal-of-opportunity framework. First, we introduce a LEO orbit model that accounts for Earth's non-sphericity and derive a wideband communication model that captures fast- and slow-time Doppler effects and multipath propagation. Subsequently, we perform a misspecified Cram\u00e9r-Rao bound (MCRB) analysis to evaluate the impact of orbital errors on positioning performance.

Therefore, this paper initially incorporates the FD-RIS into the CC systems and proposes the corresponding CC transmission scheme. Specifically, we first develop the signal processing model of the FD-RIS, which considers effective control of harmonic signals by leveraging the time-delay techniques. The joint distance-angle beamforming capability is then validated through its normalized beampattern. Based on this model, we then construct an FD-RIS-assisted CC system under a multi-warden scenario and derive an approximate closed-form expression for the covert constraints by considering the worst-case eavesdropping conditions and utilizing the logarithmic moment-generating function. An optimization problem is formulated which aims at maximizing the covert user's achievable rate under covert constrains by jointly designing the time delays and modulation frequencies. To tackle this non-convex problem, an iterative algorithm with assured convergence is proposed to effectively solve the time-delay and modulation frequency variables. To evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme, we consider three communication scenarios with varying spatial correlations between the covert user and wardens. Simulation results demonstrate that FD-RIS can significantly improve covert performance, particularly in angular-overlap scenarios where traditional RIS experiences severe degradation. These findings further highlight the effectiveness of FD-RIS in enhancing CC robustness under challenging spatial environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u9891\u7387\u53ef\u91cd\u6784\u667a\u80fd\u8868\u9762(FD-RIS)\u7684\u9690\u853d\u901a\u4fe1\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8054\u5408\u8ddd\u79bb-\u89d2\u5ea6\u6ce2\u675f\u8d4b\u5f62\u80fd\u529b\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edfRIS\u5728\u9690\u853d\u901a\u4fe1\u4e2d\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u76f2\u533a\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfRIS\u8f85\u52a9\u7684\u9690\u853d\u901a\u4fe1\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b58\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u76f2\u533a\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u800cFD-RIS\u7684\u8054\u5408\u8ddd\u79bb-\u89d2\u5ea6\u6ce2\u675f\u8d4b\u5f62\u80fd\u529b\u5177\u6709\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u9650\u5236\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u9996\u5148\u5f00\u53d1FD-RIS\u7684\u4fe1\u53f7\u5904\u7406\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u65f6\u5ef6\u6280\u672f\u63a7\u5236\u8c10\u6ce2\u4fe1\u53f7\uff1b\u7136\u540e\u6784\u5efa\u591a\u770b\u5b88\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684FD-RIS\u8f85\u52a9\u9690\u853d\u901a\u4fe1\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u9690\u853d\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3c\u95ed\u5f0f\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\uff1b\u6700\u540e\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8fed\u4ee3\u7b97\u6cd5\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u65f6\u5ef6\u548c\u8c03\u5236\u9891\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cFD-RIS\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u9690\u853d\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u89d2\u5ea6\u91cd\u53e0\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f20\u7edfRIS\u6027\u80fd\u4e25\u91cd\u6076\u5316\u65f6FD-RIS\u4ecd\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u826f\u597d\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "FD-RIS\u5728\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7a7a\u95f4\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u589e\u5f3a\u9690\u853d\u901a\u4fe1\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u89d2\u5ea6\u91cd\u53e0\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002"}}

Leveraging these MIP analyses, we present several extended insights, including reliable recovery conditions in noisy scenarios and the optimal hierarchical structure for cases where sparsity is not equal to zero.

In this paper, we proposes a novel Meta-GFlowNet framework that achieves rapid adaptation to dynamic conditions using model-agnostic meta-learning. As the communication user is moving, the framework learns a direction-general prior across user directions via inner trajectory-balance updates and outer meta-updates, enabling quick convergence to new user directions. The approach requires no labeled data, employing a pseudo-supervised consistency objective derived from the learned reward by GFlowNet and the actual sum-rate reward of the TM-IRS system. Simulation results show that the proposed method attains faster adaptation and higher secrecy performance than retrained GFlowNets, offering an efficient GenAI framework for dynamic wireless environments.

Recognizing the performance degradation caused by environmental blockers, the system introduces a joint waveform design that ensures robust operation under varying channel conditions. A channel switching mechanism is deployed to reroute communication through alternative non-line-of-sight paths when the primary line-of-sight links are obstructed. Moreover, a dynamic power allocation strategy enforces a minimum rate constraint for the weak NOMA user, ensuring consistent quality of service. Extensive simulations over multiple blockage scenarios and signal to noise (SNR) conditions validate the effectiveness of the proposed solution. Notably, under severe blockage, the system achieves up to a 400% sensing rate enhancement at 15 dB SNR, with only a 20% reduction in communication rate.

In an attempt to address the global digital divide problem, this paper explores a multi-high-altitude platform system (HAPS)-ground integrated network, in which multiple HAPSs collaborate with ground base stations (BSs) to enhance the users' quality of service on the ground to achieve the highly sought-after digital equity. To this end, this paper considers maximizing both the network-wide weighted sum rate function and the worst-case signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) function subject to the same system level constraints. More specifically, the paper tackles the two different optimization problems so as to balance throughput and fairness, by accounting for the individual HAPS payload connectivity constraints, HAPS and BS distinct power limitations, and per-user rate requirements. This paper solves the considered problems using techniques from optimization theory by adopting a generalized assignment problem (GAP)-based methodology to determine the user association variables, jointly with successive convex approximation (SCA)-based iterative algorithms for optimizing the corresponding beamforming vectors. One of the main advantages of the proposed algorithms is their amenability for distributed implementation across the multiple HAPSs and BSs.

These activities, such as air taxis, rely on low-altitude wireless networks, and one key enabling technology is integrated sensing and communication (ISAC). However, in low-altitude airspace, ISAC is vulnerable to channel-access attacks, thereby degrading performance and threatening safety. To address this, we propose a defense framework based on a Stackelberg game. Specifically, we first model the system under attack, deriving metrics for the communication and the sensing to quantify performance. Then, we formulate the interaction as a three-player game where a malicious attacker acts as the leader, while the legitimate drone and ground base station act as followers. Using a backward induction algorithm, we obtain the Stackelberg equilibrium, allowing the defenders to dynamically adjust their strategies to mitigate the attack.

In particular, the conventional MGM beamforming requires substantial computational complexity and feedback (or pilot) overhead for acquisition of channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT), while simultaneous interference management and multicast beamforming optimization across multi-group inevitably incurs a significant rate loss. To address this, we propose a CSIT-free MGM (CF-MGM) transmission that eliminates the need for a complex CSIT acquisition. A deterministic CSIT-free precoding and proposed closed-form power allocation based on max-min fairness (MMF) allow each user to detect the common multicast stream completely canceling the inter-group interference with a significantly low complexity. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority and scalability of the proposed CF-MGM for the achievable rate and increase of users in a group outperforming the existing CSIT-based methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700CSIT\u7684\u591a\u7ec4\u591a\u64ad\u4f20\u8f93\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u9884\u7f16\u7801\u548c\u95ed\u5f0f\u529f\u7387\u5206\u914d\u6d88\u9664\u7ec4\u95f4\u5e72\u6270\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u591a\u7ec4\u591a\u64ad\u6ce2\u675f\u6210\u5f62\u9700\u8981\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u548c\u5927\u91cf\u53cd\u9988\u5f00\u9500\u83b7\u53d6CSIT\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u7ba1\u7406\u5e72\u6270\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u6ce2\u675f\u6210\u5f62\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u663e\u8457\u901f\u7387\u635f\u5931\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u786e\u5b9a\u6027CSIT-free\u9884\u7f16\u7801\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6700\u5927\u6700\u5c0f\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u7684\u95ed\u5f0f\u529f\u7387\u5206\u914d\uff0c\u8ba9\u6bcf\u4e2a\u7528\u6237\u80fd\u5b8c\u5168\u6d88\u9664\u7ec4\u95f4\u5e72\u6270\u68c0\u6d4b\u516c\u5171\u591a\u64ad\u6d41\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u901f\u7387\u548c\u7ec4\u5185\u7528\u6237\u589e\u52a0\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u6240\u63d0CF-MGM\u65b9\u6848\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8eCSIT\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "CF-MGM\u4f20\u8f93\u65b9\u6848\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u9ad8\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u6beb\u7c73\u6ce2\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u591a\u7ec4\u591a\u64ad\u4f20\u8f93\u3002"}}

This paper derives the closed-form Cramer-Rao bounds (CRBs) for joint velocity estimation using a modular linear array (MLA) within a predictive-beamforming framework. The analysis shows that increasing inter-module separation enlarges the effective aperture and reduces the transverse-velocity CRB, whereas the radial-velocity CRB is largely insensitive to separation. We further obtain a simple closed-form relation linking the achievable antenna savings to the inter-module separation while preserving the same transverse accuracy of a uniform linear array (ULA). We further investigate how velocity mismatch affects array gain and show that transverse-velocity errors cause more severe performance degradation than radial-velocity errors.

The UAV simultaneously serves its own ground network and acts as a friendly jammer to enhance the covertness of satellite transmissions. We derive a closed-form lower bound on the warden's average minimum detection error probability which is then used to define the covert constraint. Building on this, we formulate an optimization problem to jointly design the UAV's 3D placement, its power allocation, and the satellite's transmit power to maximize the system's covert rate. To solve the resulting non-convex problem, we propose an algorithm based on the block coordinate descent (BCD) and successive convex approximation (SCA) techniques, and further develop a Dinkelbach's algorithm for a special case.

Unlike previous studies that mainly rely on idealized isotropic antenna models, we adopt a polarimetric model that takes advantage of effective aperture distribution functions to characterize realistic antenna patterns, placements, and polarization effects. Based on this model, we analyze the fundamental limits of UE positioning using the Fisher information matrix (FIM) and the position error bound (PEB). The FIM is shown to be expressed as a weighted sum of the information contributions from individual access point (AP)-UE pairs, with each contribution interpreted geometrically across distance, azimuth, and elevation dimensions. The impact of the UE tilt and the spatial distribution of APs on the PEBs is further analyzed. As a further advancement, we propose a complete positioning framework from a UE tracking perspective. By integrating a global probability hypothesis density filter and a PEB-aware AP management strategy, the framework enables accurate tracking while optimizing AP scheduling.

The difficulty of the problem is further amplified in structural systems subjected to natural hazards such as earthquakes or windstorms, where responses are often highly transient, nonlinear, and spatially distributed. To address this challenge, we introduce Spectrum and Physics-Informed Neural Networks (SaPINNs) for efficient input--state--parameter estimation in systems under complex excitations characteristic of natural hazards. The proposed model enhances the neural network with governing physics of the system dynamics and incorporates spectral information of natural hazards by using empirically derived spectra as priors on the unknown excitations. This integration improves inference of unmeasured inputs, system states, and parameters without imposing restrictive assumptions on their dynamics. The performance of the proposed framework is demonstrated through comparative studies on both linear and nonlinear systems under various types of excitation, including the El Centro earthquake, where the seismic spectrum is assumed to be not precisely known. To account for predictive uncertainty, the proposed architecture is embedded within a Deep Ensemble (DEns) networks architecture, providing distributions over possible solutions. The results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms conventional PINNs, as the incorporation of spectral information introduces an inductive bias that guides the network more effectively through the solution space and enhances its ability to recover physically consistent state and parameter estimates with realistic uncertainty levels.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9891\u8c31\u548c\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc(SaPINNs)\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u81ea\u7136\u5371\u5bb3\u590d\u6742\u6fc0\u52b1\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc6\u522b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u7269\u7406\u65b9\u7a0b\u548c\u9891\u8c31\u5148\u9a8c\u6765\u6539\u8fdb\u672a\u77e5\u6fc0\u52b1\u3001\u7cfb\u7edf\u72b6\u6001\u548c\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5728\u672a\u77e5\u5916\u90e8\u6fc0\u52b1\u4e0b\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u75c5\u6001\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u81ea\u7136\u5371\u5bb3(\u5982\u5730\u9707\u3001\u98ce\u66b4)\u4e2d\u7cfb\u7edf\u54cd\u5e94\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u5ea6\u77ac\u6001\u3001\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u5e03\u7279\u6027\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u4e0e\u7cfb\u7edf\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u7a0b\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u7ecf\u9a8c\u63a8\u5bfc\u7684\u9891\u8c31\u4f5c\u4e3a\u672a\u77e5\u6fc0\u52b1\u7684\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6df1\u5ea6\u96c6\u6210\u7f51\u7edc\u67b6\u6784\u5904\u7406\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u7ebf\u6027\u548c\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6bd4\u8f83\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edfPINNs\uff0c\u9891\u8c31\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u5f15\u5165\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5f52\u7eb3\u504f\u7f6e\uff0c\u80fd\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u5730\u5f15\u5bfc\u7f51\u7edc\u627e\u5230\u7269\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u5e76\u6062\u590d\u5177\u6709\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6c34\u5e73\u7684\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u72b6\u6001\u548c\u53c2\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "conclusion": "SaPINNs\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u7269\u7406\u77e5\u8bc6\u548c\u9891\u8c31\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5728\u590d\u6742\u81ea\u7136\u5371\u5bb3\u6fc0\u52b1\u4e0b\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Unlike the far-field scenario, near-field wavefronts exhibit strong dependencies on both angle and distance due to spherical wave propagation, leading to complicated variations in received signal strength (RSS). To effectively capture the intricate spatial variations structure inherent in near-field environments, a regularized RBF interpolation method is developed to enhance radio map reconstruction accuracy. Leveraging theoretical insights from interpolation error analysis of RBF, an inverse \u03bc-law-inspired nonuniform sampling strategy is introduced to allocate measurements adaptively, emphasizing regions with rapid RSS variations near the transmitter. To further exploit the global low-rank structure in the near-field radio map, we integrate RBF interpolation with nuclear norm minimization (NNM)-based matrix completion. A robust Huberized leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) scheme is then proposed for adaptive selection of the tolerance parameter, facilitating optimal fusion between RBF interpolation and matrix completion. The integration of local variation structure modeling via RBF interpolation and global low-rank structure exploitation via matrix completion yields a structure-aware framework that substantially improves the accuracy of near-field radio map reconstruction. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves over 10% improvement in normalized mean squared error (NMSE) compared to standard interpolation and matrix completion methods under varying sampling densities and shadowing conditions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u6784\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u77e9\u9635\u8865\u5168\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5f84\u5411\u57fa\u51fd\u6570\u63d2\u503c\u6765\u6784\u5efaXL-MIMO\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u8fd1\u573a\u65e0\u7ebf\u7535\u5730\u56fe\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c40\u90e8\u53d8\u5316\u7ed3\u6784\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u4f4e\u79e9\u7ed3\u6784\u5229\u7528\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u91cd\u5efa\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u8fd1\u573a\u6ce2\u524d\u7531\u4e8e\u7403\u9762\u6ce2\u4f20\u64ad\u5728\u89d2\u5ea6\u548c\u8ddd\u79bb\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u5f3a\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u63a5\u6536\u4fe1\u53f7\u5f3a\u5ea6\u53d8\u5316\u590d\u6742\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u6355\u6349\u8fd9\u79cd\u590d\u6742\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u53d8\u5316\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u6b63\u5219\u5316RBF\u63d2\u503c\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u9006\u03bc\u5f8b\u975e\u5747\u5300\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6838\u8303\u6570\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u77e9\u9635\u8865\u5168\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u9c81\u68d2\u7684Huberized\u7559\u4e00\u4ea4\u53c9\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65b9\u6848\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u9009\u62e9\u5bb9\u5dee\u53c2\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u91c7\u6837\u5bc6\u5ea6\u548c\u9634\u5f71\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u6807\u51c6\u63d2\u503c\u548c\u77e9\u9635\u8865\u5168\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u5747\u65b9\u8bef\u5dee\u6539\u5584\u8d85\u8fc710%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7RBF\u63d2\u503c\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u53d8\u5316\u7ed3\u6784\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0e\u77e9\u9635\u8865\u5168\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u4f4e\u79e9\u7ed3\u6784\u5229\u7528\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u611f\u77e5\u6846\u67b6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u8fd1\u573a\u65e0\u7ebf\u7535\u5730\u56fe\u91cd\u5efa\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002"}}

However, the deployment of Edge AI systems faces significant challenges due to high energy consumption and extended operation time.\n  In this paper, we consider an Edge AI system which integrates the data acquisition, computation and communication processes, and focus on improving learning performance of this system. We model the time and energy consumption of different processes and perform a rigorous convergence analysis to quantify the impact of key system parameters, such as the amount of collected data and the number of training rounds, on the learning performance. Based on this analysis, we formulate a system-wide optimization problem that seeks to maximize learning performance under given time and energy constraints. We explore both homogeneous and heterogeneous device scenarios, developing low-complexity algorithms based on one-dimensional search and alternating optimization to jointly optimize data collection time and training rounds.

To provide connectivity to a massive number of these nodes, backscatter communication (BC) is emerging as an energy- and cost-efficient technology exploiting the reflection of radio frequency signals. However, challenges such as round-trip path loss and direct link interference (DLI) between the carrier emitter and the reader limit its performance. To tackle these limitations, this paper proposes a joint access point role selection and a novel beamforming technique for bistatic BC in a distributed multiple-input multiple- output setup. The proposed approach boosts the received backscattered energy while effectively mitigating DLI, thereby reducing the error probability. We also propose a channel estimation method tailored to operate under DLI conditions and propose a mismatch detector using estimated channel coefficients. Furthermore, we derive a closed-form expression for the probability of error for the detectors and model the quantization noise caused by DLI. Finally, comprehensive simulation results show that the proposed method with 1-bit analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) effectively mitigates DLI, reduces the quantization noise, and enhances backscattered signal energy, achieving performance comparable to the benchmark scenario with 8-bit ADCs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u5206\u5e03\u5f0fMIMO\u53cc\u57fa\u5730\u53cd\u5411\u6563\u5c04\u901a\u4fe1\u7684\u8054\u5408\u63a5\u5165\u70b9\u89d2\u8272\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u6ce2\u675f\u6210\u5f62\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u589e\u5f3a\u53cd\u5411\u6563\u5c04\u4fe1\u53f7\u80fd\u91cf\u5e76\u6291\u5236\u76f4\u63a5\u94fe\u8def\u5e72\u6270\uff0c\u57281\u4f4dADC\u4e0b\u8fbe\u5230\u4e0e8\u4f4dADC\u57fa\u51c6\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u53cd\u5411\u6563\u5c04\u901a\u4fe1\u4e2d\u7684\u5f80\u8fd4\u8def\u5f84\u635f\u8017\u548c\u76f4\u63a5\u94fe\u8def\u5e72\u6270\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u8282\u70b9\u63d0\u4f9b\u80fd\u91cf\u548c\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u8fde\u63a5\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u8054\u5408\u63a5\u5165\u70b9\u89d2\u8272\u9009\u62e9\u3001\u65b0\u578b\u6ce2\u675f\u6210\u5f62\u6280\u672f\u3001\u9488\u5bf9DLI\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u4fe1\u9053\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f30\u8ba1\u4fe1\u9053\u7cfb\u6570\u7684\u5931\u914d\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u57281\u4f4dADC\u4e0b\u6709\u6548\u6291\u5236DLI\u3001\u51cf\u5c11\u91cf\u5316\u566a\u58f0\u3001\u589e\u5f3a\u53cd\u5411\u6563\u5c04\u4fe1\u53f7\u80fd\u91cf\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e8\u4f4dADC\u57fa\u51c6\u76f8\u5f53\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u53cd\u5411\u6563\u5c04\u901a\u4fe1\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u4f4e\u529f\u8017\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u7f51\u7edc\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Cooperation among AVs is successful when the environment is unknown, or changes dynamically, so as to improve coverage and trip time, and minimize the traveled distance. The AVs, while mapping the environment with range-based sensors, move across the wireless coverage areas, with consequences on the achieved access bit rate, latency, and handover rate. In this paper, we propose to modify the cost of path planning algorithms such as Dijkstra and A*, so that not only the traveled distance is considered in the best path solution, but also the radio coverage experience. To this aim, several radio-related cost-weighting functions are introduced and tested, to assess the performance of the proposed techniques with extensive simulations.

This paper introduces MARBLE-Net (Multipath-Aware Rainbow Beam Learning Network), a deep learning framework that jointly optimizes the analog beamforming parameters of a frequency-dependent rainbow beam and a neural localization network for high-accuracy position estimation. By treating the phase-shifter (PS) and true-time-delay (TTD) parameters as learnable weights, the system adaptively refines its sensing beam to exploit environment-specific multipath characteristics. A structured multi-stage training strategy is proposed to ensure stable convergence and effective end-to-end optimization. Simulation results show that MARBLE-Net outperforms both a fixed-beam deep learning baseline (RaiNet) and a traditional k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) method, reducing localization error by more than 50\\% in a multipath-rich scene. Moreover, the results reveal a nuanced interaction with multipath propagation: while confined uni-directional multipath degrades accuracy, structured and directional multipath can be effectively exploited to achieve performance surpassing even line-of-sight (LoS) conditions.", "AI": {"tldr": "MARBLE-Net\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u5f69\u8679\u6ce2\u675f\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u6ce2\u675f\u6210\u5f62\u53c2\u6570\u548c\u795e\u7ecf\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u5728\u590d\u6742\u591a\u5f84\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u76ee\u6807\u5b9a\u4f4d\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u590d\u6742\u65e0\u7ebf\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u591a\u5f84\u4f20\u64ad\u5bf9\u96c6\u6210\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u901a\u4fe1(ISAC)\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u76ee\u6807\u5b9a\u4f4d\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u591a\u5f84\u7279\u6027\u7684\u5b9a\u4f4d\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMARBLE-Net\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u76f8\u4f4d\u79fb\u76f8\u5668\u548c\u771f\u65f6\u5ef6\u53c2\u6570\u4f5c\u4e3a\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4f18\u5316\u611f\u77e5\u6ce2\u675f\u4ee5\u5229\u7528\u73af\u5883\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u591a\u5f84\u7279\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0cMARBLE-Net\u5728\u4e30\u5bcc\u591a\u5f84\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u6bd4\u56fa\u5b9a\u6ce2\u675f\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u57fa\u51c6(RaiNet)\u548c\u4f20\u7edfk-NN\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9a\u4f4d\u8bef\u5dee\u51cf\u5c11\u8d85\u8fc750%\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u591a\u5f84\u5b9e\u73b0\u8d85\u8d8a\u89c6\u8ddd\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "MARBLE-Net\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u6ce2\u675f\u6210\u5f62\u548c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u591a\u5f84\u4f20\u64ad\u7684\u5fae\u5999\u5f71\u54cd\uff1a\u53d7\u9650\u5355\u5411\u591a\u5f84\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u800c\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5b9a\u5411\u591a\u5f84\u53ef\u88ab\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Existing studies exploring methods for unknown emitters identification, however, are typically hindered by their dependence on labeled or proprietary datasets, unrealistic assumptions (e.g. all samples with identical transmitted messages), or deficiency of systematic evaluations across different architectures and design dimensions. In this work, we present a comprehensive evaluation of unknown emitter detection systems across key aspects of the design space, focusing on data modality, learning approaches, and feature learn- ing modules. We demonstrate that prior self-supervised, zero-shot emitter detection approaches commonly use datasets with identical transmitted messages. To address this limitation, we propose a 2D- Constellation data modality for scenarios with varying messages, achieving up to a 40\\% performance improvement in ROC-AUC, NMI, and F1 metrics compared to conventional raw I/Q data. Furthermore, we introduce interpretable Kolmogorov--Arnold Net- works (KANs) to enhance model transparency, and a Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)-based initialization procedure for feature learning modules operating on sparse 2D-Constellation data, which improves the performance of Deep Clustering approaches by up to 40\\% across the same metrics comparing to the modules without SVD initialization.

Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) provide valuable tools for logistics collection within LAE systems, offering the ability to navigate through complex environments, avoid obstacles, and improve operational efficiency.

Specifically, the LKH algorithm determines the optimal order of item collection, while the DDPG algorithm designs the flight trajectory between collection points.

By exploiting the beamforming capabilities of massive MIMO, multicasting provides a spectrum-efficient solution that avoids unnecessary intra-group interference. A key challenge, however, is solving the max-min fair (MMF) and quality-of-service (QoS) multicast beamforming optimization problems, which are NP-hard due to the non-convex structure and the requirement for rank-1 solutions. Traditional approaches based on semidefinite relaxation (SDR) followed by randomization exhibit poor scalability with system size, while state-of-the-art successive convex approximation (SCA) methods only guarantee convergence to stationary points. In this paper, we propose an alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM)-based framework for MMF and QoS multicast beamforming in cell-free massive MIMO networks. The algorithm leverages SDR but incorporates a novel iterative elimination strategy within the ADMM updates to efficiently obtain near-global optimal rank-1 beamforming solutions with reduced computational complexity compared to standard SDP solvers and randomization methods.

While essentially all soft-decision decoders assume that bits have been impacted independently on the channel, for one of these new approaches it has been established that channel dependencies can be exploited to achieve superior decoding accuracy, resulting in Ordered Reliability Bits Guessing Random Additive Noise Decoding Approximate Independence (ORBGRAND-AI). Building on that capability, here we consider the integration of ORBGRAND-AI as a pattern generator for Guessing Codeword Decoding (GCD). We first establish that a direct approach delivers mildly degraded block error rate (BLER) but with reduced number of queried patterns when compared to ORBGRAND-AI. We then show that with a more nuanced approach it is possible to leverage total correlation to deliver an additional BLER improvement of around 0.75 dB while retaining reduced query numbers.", "AI": {"tldr": "ORBGRAND-AI\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6a21\u5f0f\u751f\u6210\u5668\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u731c\u6d4b\u7801\u5b57\u89e3\u7801(GCD)\u4e2d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u4fe1\u9053\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u51cf\u5c11\u67e5\u8be2\u6a21\u5f0f\u6570\u91cf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u6539\u5584\u5757\u9519\u8bef\u7387(BLER)\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8f6f\u5224\u51b3\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u901a\u5e38\u5047\u8bbe\u6bd4\u7279\u5728\u4fe1\u9053\u4e2d\u72ec\u7acb\u53d7\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4f46ORBGRAND-AI\u5df2\u8bc1\u660e\u53ef\u4ee5\u5229\u7528\u4fe1\u9053\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u63d0\u9ad8\u89e3\u7801\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u5c06ORBGRAND-AI\u96c6\u6210\u5230GCD\u4e2d\uff0c\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u5229\u7528\u603b\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u6539\u5584\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u9996\u5148\u91c7\u7528\u76f4\u63a5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06ORBGRAND-AI\u4f5c\u4e3aGCD\u7684\u6a21\u5f0f\u751f\u6210\u5668\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u91c7\u7528\u66f4\u7ec6\u81f4\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5229\u7528\u603b\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u6765\u4f18\u5316\u89e3\u7801\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u76f4\u63a5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u51cf\u5c11\u67e5\u8be2\u6a21\u5f0f\u6570\u91cf\u7684\u540c\u65f6BLER\u7565\u6709\u4e0b\u964d\uff1b\u66f4\u7ec6\u81f4\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u989d\u5916\u5e26\u6765\u7ea60.75 dB\u7684BLER\u6539\u5584\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u51cf\u5c11\u7684\u67e5\u8be2\u6570\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06ORBGRAND-AI\u96c6\u6210\u5230GCD\u4e2d\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u603b\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u51cf\u5c11\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u89e3\u7801\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Achieving such phase alignment is technically challenging, as it requires tight synchronization among geographically distributed APs. In this paper, we address this issue by introducing a differential space-time block coding (DSTBC) approach that bypasses the need for AP phase synchronization. We first provide analytic bounds to the achievable spectral efficiency of CF-mMIMO with phase-unsynchronized APs. Then, we propose a DSTBC-based transmission scheme specifically tailored to CF-mMIMO, which operates without channel state information and does not require any form of phase synchronization among the APs. We derive a closed-form expression for the resulting signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR), enabling quantitative comparisons among different DSTBC schemes. Numerical simulations confirm that phase misalignments can significantly impair system performance. In contrast, the proposed DSTBC scheme successfully mitigates these effects, achieving performance comparable to that of fully synchronized systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700AP\u76f8\u4f4d\u540c\u6b65\u7684\u5dee\u5206\u7a7a\u65f6\u5757\u7f16\u7801(DSTBC)\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u65e0\u8702\u7a9d\u5927\u89c4\u6a21MIMO\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u76f8\u4f4d\u540c\u6b65\u6311\u6218\u3002", "motivation": "\u65e0\u8702\u7a9d\u5927\u89c4\u6a21MIMO\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u4e0b\u884c\u94fe\u8def\u6027\u80fd\u4e25\u91cd\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u8054\u5408\u76f8\u5e72\u4f20\u8f93\uff0c\u8fd9\u9700\u8981\u5730\u7406\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u63a5\u5165\u70b9\u4e4b\u95f4\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u76f8\u4f4d\u540c\u6b65\uff0c\u8fd9\u5728\u6280\u672f\u4e0a\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u5dee\u5206\u7a7a\u65f6\u5757\u7f16\u7801(DSTBC)\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4fe1\u9053\u72b6\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4e5f\u4e0d\u9700\u8981AP\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4efb\u4f55\u76f8\u4f4d\u540c\u6b65\u5f62\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u76f8\u4f4d\u5931\u51c6\u4f1a\u663e\u8457\u635f\u5bb3\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u800c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684DSTBC\u65b9\u6848\u6210\u529f\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e0e\u5b8c\u5168\u540c\u6b65\u7cfb\u7edf\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "DSTBC\u65b9\u6848\u4e3a\u65e0\u8702\u7a9d\u5927\u89c4\u6a21MIMO\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u76f8\u4f4d\u540c\u6b65\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u65e0\u9700\u76f8\u4f4d\u540c\u6b65\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u63a5\u8fd1\u5b8c\u5168\u540c\u6b65\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}
