### [1] [Generative Modeling and Decision Fusion for Unknown Event Detection and Classification Using Synchrophasor Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22795)
*Yi Hu,Zheyuan Cheng*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合生成建模、滑动窗口处理和决策融合的电力系统事件检测与分类框架，能够识别已知事件并将未知扰动分类为新类别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Conclusion: 该框架具有适应性和实用价值，能够解决监督分类器的关键限制，适用于现代电力系统的广域事件分析。

Abstract: Reliable detection and classification of power system events are critical for
maintaining grid stability and situational awareness. Existing approaches often
depend on limited labeled datasets, which restricts their ability to generalize
to rare or unseen disturbances. This paper proposes a novel framework that
integrates generative modeling, sliding-window temporal processing, and
decision fusion to achieve robust event detection and classification using
synchrophasor data. A variational autoencoder-generative adversarial network is
employed to model normal operating conditions, where both reconstruction error
and discriminator error are extracted as anomaly indicators. Two complementary
decision strategies are developed: a threshold-based rule for computational
efficiency and a convex hull-based method for robustness under complex error
distributions. These features are organized into spatiotemporal detection and
classification matrices through a sliding-window mechanism, and an
identification and decision fusion stage integrates the outputs across PMUs.
This design enables the framework to identify known events while systematically
classifying previously unseen disturbances into a new category, addressing a
key limitation of supervised classifiers. Experimental results demonstrate
state-of-the-art accuracy, surpassing machine learning, deep learning, and
envelope-based baselines. The ability to recognize unknown events further
highlights the adaptability and practical value of the proposed approach for
wide-area event analysis in modern power systems.

*Jianheng Zhou,Chenyu Liu,Jinan Zhou,Yi Ding,Yang Liu,Haoran Luo,Ziyu Jia,Xinliang Zhou*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的睡眠分期方法，将一维PSG信号转换为二维波形图像，利用多模态大模型模拟临床诊断流程，在多个数据集上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动睡眠分期方法依赖复杂PSG信号特征提取和领域特定模型，缺乏直观性且需要大量专业数据。

Method: 将原始一维PSG时间序列转换为直观的二维波形图像，然后微调多模态大模型学习这些表示。

Result: 在三个公共数据集上的实验表明，该方法使通用模型无需先验睡眠数据知识即可获得稳健的分期能力，且性能优于最先进基线。

Conclusion: 该方法能模拟人类专家基于PSG图像的视觉诊断流程，具有高效性和医学应用价值。

Abstract: Sleep staging is essential for diagnosing sleep disorders and assessing
neurological health. Existing automatic methods typically extract features from
complex polysomnography (PSG) signals and train domain-specific models, which
often lack intuitiveness and require large, specialized datasets. To overcome
these limitations, we introduce a new paradigm for sleep staging that leverages
large multimodal general-purpose models to emulate clinical diagnostic
practices. Specifically, we convert raw one-dimensional PSG time-series into
intuitive two-dimensional waveform images and then fine-tune a multimodal large
model to learn from these representations. Experiments on three public datasets
(ISRUC, MASS, SHHS) demonstrate that our approach enables general-purpose
models, without prior exposure to sleep data, to acquire robust staging
capabilities. Moreover, explanation analysis reveals our model learned to mimic
the visual diagnostic workflow of human experts for sleep staging by PSG
images. The proposed method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines
in accuracy and robustness, highlighting its efficiency and practical value for
medical applications. The code for the signal-to-image pipeline and the PSG
image dataset will be released.

### [3] [Scalable Wi-Fi RSS-Based Indoor Localization via Automatic Vision-Assisted Calibration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22869)
*Abdulkadir Bilge,Erdem Ergen,Burak Soner,Sinem Coleri*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种轻量级框架，通过摄像头辅助的短时校准阶段自动收集高分辨率同步RSS-位置数据，用于训练可移动部署的Wi-Fi定位算法，解决了传统监督学习方法需要大量标注数据的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Wi-Fi定位在室内环境中具有广泛应用前景，但基于RSS的方法易受多径效应、信道变化和接收器特性的影响。监督学习方法虽然更鲁棒，但需要大量标注数据，收集成本高昂。

Method: 使用一次性校准的顶置摄像头跟踪设备，收集来自附近接入点的广播数据包的RSS数据，生成(x, y, RSS)数据集，自动训练可移动部署的定位算法。

Result: 量化了视觉辅助RSS数据收集在跟踪精度和标签同步等关键因素下的精度限制，通过实验数据验证了传统和监督学习方法在不同信号条件和设备类型下的性能，展示了改进的准确性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: 所提出的框架在实用中具有有效性，所有代码、工具和数据集均已开源发布。

Abstract: Wi-Fi-based positioning promises a scalable and privacy-preserving solution
for location-based services in indoor environments such as malls, airports, and
campuses. RSS-based methods are widely deployable as RSS data is available on
all Wi-Fi-capable devices, but RSS is highly sensitive to multipath, channel
variations, and receiver characteristics. While supervised learning methods
offer improved robustness, they require large amounts of labeled data, which is
often costly to obtain. We introduce a lightweight framework that solves this
by automating high-resolution synchronized RSS-location data collection using a
short, camera-assisted calibration phase. An overhead camera is calibrated only
once with ArUco markers and then tracks a device collecting RSS data from
broadcast packets of nearby access points across Wi-Fi channels. The resulting
(x, y, RSS) dataset is used to automatically train mobile-deployable
localization algorithms, avoiding the privacy concerns of continuous video
monitoring. We quantify the accuracy limits of such vision-assisted RSS data
collection under key factors such as tracking precision and label
synchronization. Using the collected experimental data, we benchmark
traditional and supervised learning approaches under varying signal conditions
and device types, demonstrating improved accuracy and generalization,
validating the utility of the proposed framework for practical use. All code,
tools, and datasets are released as open source.

### [4] [Time-Frequency Analysis of Non-Uniformly Sampled Signals via Sample Density Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22891)
*Ashwini Kulkarni,Santosh Nannuru*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于非均匀采样数据的时频分析方法——非均匀Stockwell变换(NUST)，该方法使用双重自适应窗口，在频率和局部数据密度上调整窗口宽度，能够同时检测瞬态和持续信号。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如广义Lomb-Scargle周期图对瞬态事件不敏感，而传统时频方法在处理非均匀采样数据时存在固定窗口或插值等次优问题。

Method: NUST框架直接对非均匀采样数据应用局部密度自适应谱分析，采用基于频率和局部数据密度的双重自适应窗口。

Result: 在多个非均匀采样合成信号上验证了NUST的优越时域定位性能，并成功应用于HD 10180多行星系统的HARPS径向速度数据，有效区分了行星信号和恒星活动。

Conclusion: NUST为非均匀采样数据的时频分析提供了有效的解决方案，能够同时处理瞬态和持续信号，在行星探测等领域具有应用价值。

Abstract: The analysis of non-stationary signals in non-uniformly sampled data is a
challenging task. Time-integrated methods, such as the generalised Lomb-Scargle
(GLS) periodogram, provide a robust statistical assessment of persistent
periodicities but are insensitive to transient events. Conversely, existing
time-frequency methods often rely on fixed-duration windows or interpolation,
which can be suboptimal for non-uniform data. We introduce the non-uniform
Stockwell-transform (NUST), a time-frequency framework that applies a localized
density adaptive spectral analysis directly to non-uniformly sampled data. NUST
employs a doubly adaptive window that adjusts its width based on both frequency
and local data density, providing detailed time-frequency information for both
transient and persistent signals. We validate the NUST on numerous
non-uniformly sampled synthetic signals, demonstrating its superior
time-localization performance compared to GLS. Furthermore, we apply NUST to
HARPS radial velocity data of the multi-planetary system HD 10180, successfully
distinguishing coherent planetary signals from stellar activity.

### [5] [Resource Allocation in Cooperative Mid-band/THz Networks in the Presence of Mobility](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23065)
*Mohammad Amin Saeidi,Hina Tabassum*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个优化多频段协作网络下行性能的综合框架，涵盖上中频和太赫兹频段，包含近场信道建模、天线架构和用户移动性等复杂特性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着无线通信向更高频段发展，需要解决多频段协作网络中的性能优化问题，特别是在上中频和太赫兹频段下，需要考虑近场效应、用户移动性和切换管理等挑战。

Method: 使用分数规划和主化最小化技术提出迭代算法解决非凸优化问题；针对移动用户提出两种切换感知的资源分配方法，利用Jensen不等式和对数函数特性将非凸问题近似为凸问题求解。

Result: 数值结果表明所提算法有效，协作UMB/THz网络优于独立THz网络，准确近场建模对超大规模天线阵列至关重要，切换感知资源分配方法能有效减轻切换影响。

Conclusion: 提出的框架和算法成功优化了多频段协作网络性能，特别是在处理近场效应和用户移动性方面表现出色，为未来高频段无线通信系统提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: This paper develops a comprehensive framework to investigate and optimize the
downlink performance of cooperative multi-band networks (MBNs) operating on
upper mid-band (UMB) and terahertz (THz) frequencies, where base stations (BSs)
in each band cooperatively serve users. The framework captures sophisticated
features such as near-field channel modeling, fully and partially connected
antenna architectures, and users' mobility. First, we consider joint user
association and hybrid beamforming optimization to maximize the system
sum-rate, subject to power constraints, maximum cluster size of cooperating
BSs, and users' quality-of-service (QoS) constraints. By leveraging fractional
programming FP and majorization-minimization techniques, an iterative algorithm
is proposed to solve the non-convex optimization problem. We then consider
handover (HO)-aware resource allocation for moving users in a cooperative
UMB/THz MBN. Two HO-aware resource allocation methods are proposed. The first
method focuses on maximizing the HO-aware system sum-rate subject to HO-aware
QoS constraints. Using Jensen's inequality and properties of logarithmic
functions, the non-convex optimization problem is tightly approximated with a
convex one and solved. The second method addresses a multi-objective
optimization problem to maximize the system sum-rate, while minimizing the
total number of HOs. Numerical results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed
algorithms, cooperative UMB/THz MBN over stand-alone THz networks, as well as
the critical importance of accurate near-field modeling in extremely large
antenna arrays. Moreover, the proposed HO-aware resource allocation methods
effectively mitigate the impact of HOs, enhancing performance in the considered
system.

### [6] [Dual-Function Beam Pattern Design for Multi-Target ISAC Systems: A Decoupled Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23302)
*Wilson de Souza Junior,Taufik Abrao,Amine Mezghani,Ekram Hossain*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于单基地多用户多点目标ISAC系统的波束图设计方法，通过分解感知问题并利用波束图的物理特性，在保证通信性能的同时提升多目标估计精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在ISAC系统中，感知和通信竞争资源，通信需求增加会改变波束图，可能降低DoA感知精度。传统联合优化方法往往忽视这种权衡。

Method: 将感知问题分解为两个子问题，提出SGCDF波束图设计，并使用黎曼流形优化和凸闭集投影开发低复杂度版本。

Result: 仿真结果表明，与传统联合优化相比，所提方法通过保持波束图提高了多目标估计精度，低复杂度版本在保持高精度的同时显著降低计算成本。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了ISAC系统中感知与通信的权衡问题，低复杂度版本提供了优异的性能-复杂度平衡。

Abstract: We investigate the beampattern design problem for mono-static multi-user (MU)
multi-point-target integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems, where a
dual-function multiple-input multiple-output (DF-MIMO) base station (BS)
performs downlink communication and radar sensing simultaneously. In ISAC
systems, sensing and communication inherently compete for resources. As
communication demand increases, the beam pattern is reshaped, which might
degrade the direction of arrival (DoA) sensing accuracy, measured in terms of
mean-squared error (MSE) and lower-bounded by the Cramer-Rao lower bound
(CRLB). Since conventional joint formulations of the sensing-based problem
often overlook this trade-off, our work addresses it by decomposing the
sensing-based problem into two subproblems (SPs). This decomposition enables a
more effective exploitation of the beam pattern's physical properties, which we
refer to as the Sensing-Guided Communication Dual-Function (SGCDF) beam pattern
design. We further develop a low-complexity extension using the Riemannian
Manifold Optimization (RMO) and convex closed-set projection. Simulation
results confirm that the proposed method improves multi-target estimation
accuracy, compared to traditional joint optimization strategies, by preserving
the beam pattern, while the low-complexity version offers an excellent
performance-complexity tradeoff, maintaining high accuracy with significantly
reduced computational cost.

### [7] [HoloTrace: a Location Privacy Preservation Solution for mmWave MIMO-OFDM Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23444)
*Lorenzo Italiano,Alireza Pourafzal,Hui Chen,Mattia Brambilla,Gonzalo Seco-Granados,Monica Nicoli,Henk Wymeersch*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: HoloTrace是一个信号级隐私保护框架，通过在用户端欺骗定位相关特征来防止基站从毫米波MIMO-OFDM信号中提取精确位置信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 6G蜂窝网络的技术创新带来了前所未有的用户设备定位能力，但也引发了物理层位置隐私的严重担忧。

Method: 用户通过在到达角、出发角、到达时间差等位置参数上进行欺骗，战略性地扰动导频传输，防止基站进行非授权用户定位。该方法将欺骗问题表述为统一的秩约束投影问题，并提供在有无信道状态信息情况下的闭式解。

Result: 仿真结果表明，该方法能有效欺骗基站，诱导显著定位误差，而对链路容量的影响取决于欺骗的位置。

Conclusion: HoloTrace被确立为未来6G网络中实用且鲁棒的隐私保护解决方案。

Abstract: The technological innovation towards 6G cellular networks introduces
unprecedented capabilities for user equipment (UE) localization, but it also
raises serious concerns about physical layer location privacy. This paper
introduces HoloTrace, a signal-level privacy preservation framework that relies
on user-side spoofing of localization-relevant features to prevent the
extraction of precise location information from the signals received by a base
station (BS) in a mmWave MIMO-OFDM system. Spoofing is performed by the user on
location parameters such as angle of arrival (AoA), angle of departure (AoD),
and time difference of arrival (TDoA). Without requiring any protocol
modification nor network-side support, our method strategically perturbs pilot
transmissions to prevent a BS from performing non-consensual UE localization.
The methodology allows the UE to spoof its position, keeping the precoder
unchanged. We formulate spoofing as a unified rank-constrained projection
problem, and provide closed-form solutions under varying levels of channel
state information (CSI) at the UE, including scenarios with and without CSI
knowledge. Simulation results confirm that the proposed approach enables the UE
to deceive the BS, inducing significant localization errors, while the impact
on link capacity varies depending on the spoofed position. Our findings
establish HoloTrace as a practical and robust privacy-preserving solution for
future 6G networks.

### [8] [Theoretical framework of passive ME antenna arrays enabling in-vivo monitoring: A pathway to smart implants](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23520)
*Kalpesh Jaykar,Prasanth Velvaluri,Nian X. Sun,Richard D. James*

Main category: eess.SP

Conclusion: 磁电天线阵列设计能够有效增强血管植入物的信号传输能力，为微创监测和通信提供了可行方案。

Abstract: A new brain-computer interface (BCI) technology, deployed through minimally
invasive surgery, is changing the way we think about treating severe
neurological conditions. The central idea is to place a device called Stentrode
in the brain's vasculature, which enables neuromodulation and helps patients
regain the ability to communicate. However, in such devices, the battery and
electronics are wired and could introduce damage or implant malfunction. In
these cases, a Stentrode integrated with magnetoelectric (ME) antennas could be
of great interest. ME antennas offer significant advantages over traditional
antennas, leveraging acoustic resonance rather than electromagnetic resonance
to achieve a size reduction of up to five orders of magnitude. In addition to
their compactness and immunity to ground-plane interference, ME antennas could
be adopted for use in vascular implants, such as coronary stents, potentially
enabling minimally invasive monitoring and communication. Despite these
advantages, a single antenna embedded in the implant may be constrained by the
limited volume of magnetostrictive material, which could result in low output
gain. To address this gain limitation, we propose using antenna arrays designed
to produce constructive interference at a designated far-field point, ideally
located outside the patient, to enhance signal transmission and receiving
capabilities. We develop a mathematical model to represent the antennas and
optimize their spatial arrangement and phase synchronization. Simulations based
on this model demonstrate promising high-gain performance at the prescribed
far-field location through phase manipulation.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于可学习核的有限创新率(FRI)采样框架，通过优化采样核和重建编码器，在降低采样率的同时提高分辨率和噪声鲁棒性，并实现了硬件实现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统FRI重建方法严重依赖预定义核，限制了硬件实现和在噪声条件下的重建精度，需要更灵活、鲁棒且可实际实现的框架。

Method: 首先使用截断高斯和高斯对等固定核进行重建，然后通过联合优化采样核和重建编码器获得自适应核，最后用两个指数衰减信号的和表示核以实现硬件实现。

Result: 在硬件上使用单位增益Sallen-Key模拟滤波器验证，实现了准确的实际信号恢复，基于CNN的编码器显著降低了计算复杂度，在参数较少的情况下表现出竞争力。

Conclusion: 该方法特别适合资源受限的边缘部署，提供了高效、鲁棒且可硬件实现的FRI重建解决方案。

Abstract: Finite Rate of Innovation (FRI) sampling techniques provide efficient
frameworks for reconstructing signals with inherent sparsity at rates below
Nyquist. However, traditional FRI reconstruction methods rely heavily on
pre-defined kernels, often limiting hardware implementation and reconstruction
accuracy under noisy conditions. In this paper, we propose a robust, flexible,
and practically implementable framework for FRI reconstruction by introducing
novel learnable kernel strategies. First, we demonstrate effective
reconstruction using known, fixed kernels such as truncated Gaussian and
Gaussian pair kernels, which mitigate the requirement that the samples should
have a sum-of-exponentials (SoE) form. Next, we extend this concept by jointly
optimizing both the sampling kernel and reconstruction encoder through a
unified learning approach, yielding adaptive kernels that significantly
outperform traditional methods in resolution and noise robustness, with reduced
sampling rates. Furthermore, we propose a practical hardware realization by
representing kernels as sums of two exponential decay signals with jointly
optimized poles, facilitating compact, efficient analog implementations. Our
approach is validated experimentally through hardware implementations using a
unity-gain Sallen-Key analog filter, achieving accurate real-world signal
recovery. The developed convolutional neural network-based encoder
substantially reduces computational complexity, demonstrating competitive
performance with fewer parameters, making our method particularly suitable for
resource-constrained, edge-based deployments.

*Runze Dong,Buhong Wang,Cunqian Feng,Jiang Weng,Chen Han,Jiwei Tian*

Main category: eess.SP

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要将无人机视为空中基站，忽视了其作为ISAC用户的角色，且未能利用地面基站的大规模天线阵列来提升安全性和频谱效率。

Method: 两阶段优化方法：第一阶段使用PPO算法优化数字波束成形器和轨迹；第二阶段通过低复杂度矩阵分解将数字解分解为模拟和数字分量。

Conclusion: 该框架为多无人机网络提供了安全高效的ISAC解决方案，在动态空中环境中实现了可靠的通信和精确的感知。

Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) emerges as a key enabler for
next-generation applications such as smart cities and autonomous systems. Its
integration with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) unlocks new potentials for
reliable communication and precise sensing in dynamic aerial environments.
However, existing research predominantly treats UAVs as aerial base stations,
overlooking their role as ISAC users, and fails to leverage large-scale antenna
arrays at terrestrial base stations to enhance security and spectral
efficiency. This paper propose a secure and spectral efficient ISAC framework
for multi-UAV networks, and a two-stage optimization approach is developed to
jointly design hybrid beamforming (HBF), artificial noise (AN) injection, and
UAV trajectories. Aiming at maximizing the sum secrecy rate, the first stage
employs Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to optimize digital beamformers and
trajectories, and the second stage decomposes the digital solution into analog
and digital components via low-complexity matrix factorization. Simulation
results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework compared to
benchmark schemes.

### [11] [Expectation Propagation-Based Signal Detection for Highly Correlated MIMO Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23792)
*Kabuto Arai,Takumi Yoshida,Takumi Takahashi,Koji Ishibashi*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于期望传播(EP)的检测器OvEP，通过重叠块划分和LMMSE滤波来解决大规模MIMO系统中高相关信道矩阵导致的性能下降问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模MIMO系统在密集阵列部署和有限散射环境下，信道矩阵高度相关且条件数差，严重降低了基于消息传递的检测器性能。

Method: 将大规模测量向量划分为部分重叠的块，为每个块及其重叠部分设计低复杂度LMMSE滤波器，通过减去重叠部分输出来减轻块间相关性影响。

Result: 该算法在EP框架下一致推导，其固定点理论上与松弛KL最小化问题的驻点一致，性能接近传统LMMSE-EP但计算复杂度更低。

Conclusion: OvEP算法通过重叠块划分和输出组合机制，有效缓解了高空间相关性带来的不利影响，实现了性能与复杂度的良好平衡。

Abstract: Large-scale multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) systems typically operate
in dense array deployments with limited scattering environments, leading to
highly correlated and ill-conditioned channel matrices that severely degrade
the performance of message-passing-based detectors. To tackle this issue, this
paper proposes an expectation propagation (EP)-based detector, termed
overlapping block partitioning EP (OvEP). In OvEP, the large-scale measurement
vector is partitioned into partially overlapping blocks. For each block and its
overlapping part, a low-complexity linear minimum mean square error
(LMMSE)-based filter is designed according to the partitioned structure. The
resulting LMMSE outputs are then combined to generate the input to the
denoiser. In this combining process, subtracting the overlapping-part outputs
from the block outputs effectively mitigates the adverse effects of inter-block
correlation induced by high spatial correlation. The proposed algorithm is
consistently derived within the EP framework, and its fixed point is
theoretically proven to coincide with the stationary point of a relaxed
Kullback- Leibler (KL) minimization problem. The mechanisms underlying the
theoretically predicted performance improvement are further clarified through
numerical simulations. The proposed algorithm achieves performance close to
conventional LMMSE-EP with lower computational complexity.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该论文提出了在线特定发射器识别(OSEI)任务，解决传统SEI方法无法识别未见发射器的问题。作者开发了基于哈希的CASH模型，通过两阶段处理来同时识别已知和未知发射器，在真实信号数据集上取得了显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实场景中需要识别来自未见发射器的信号，但现有模型难以处理这种情况，容易偏向已知发射器的分布。传统SEI方法只能识别训练时见过的发射器，无法适应在线识别新发射器的需求。

Method: 提出CASH模型，采用两阶段方法：1) 已知发射器识别步骤，判断信号是否来自已知发射器；2) 信号哈希编码步骤，为每个信号样本分配哈希码来识别特定发射器。该方法统一处理少样本和广义零样本学习任务。

Result: 在ADSB和ORACLE真实信号数据集上的实验表明，该方法能准确在线识别来自已知和未知发射器的信号。在少样本和广义零样本学习任务中，准确率分别比现有方法至少提高6.08%和8.55%。

Conclusion: CASH模型为OSEI任务提供了有效的统一解决方案，通过哈希编码和碰撞缓解机制，成功解决了在线识别未见发射器的挑战，在真实信号识别场景中表现出色。

Abstract: Specific Emitter Identification (SEI) has been widely studied, aiming to
distinguish signals from different emitters given training samples from those
emitters. However, real-world scenarios often require identifying signals from
novel emitters previously unseen. Since these novel emitters only have a few or
no prior samples, existing models struggle to identify signals from novel
emitters online and tend to bias toward the distribution of seen emitters. To
address these challenges, we propose the Online Specific Emitter Identification
(OSEI) task, comprising both online \revise{few-shot and generalized zero-shot}
learning tasks. It requires constructing models using signal samples from seen
emitters and then identifying new samples from seen and novel emitters online
during inference. We propose a novel hash-based model, Collision-Alleviated
Signal Hash (CASH), providing a unified approach for addressing the OSEI task.
The CASH operates in two steps: in the seen emitters identifying step, a signal
encoder and a seen emitters identifier determine whether the signal sample is
from seen emitters, mitigating the model from biasing toward seen emitters
distribution. In the signal hash coding step, an online signal hasher assigns a
hash code to each signal sample, identifying its specific emitter. Experimental
results on real-world signal datasets (i.e., ADSB and ORACLE) demonstrate that
our method accurately identifies signals from both seen and novel emitters
online. This model outperforms existing methods by a minimum of 6.08\% and
8.55\% in accuracy for the few-shot and \revise{generalized zero-shot learning
}tasks, respectively. The code will be open-sourced at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有高斯近似和粒子滤波方法在计算效率与精度之间的权衡问题，以更低成本捕捉条件分布的复杂特征。

Method: 基于系统噪声小参数的条件期望幂级数展开，结合Edgeworth型展开，通过求解常微分方程组计算展开系数。

Result: 该方法能有效捕捉条件分布的多峰性等复杂特征，计算成本显著低于传统滤波算法。

Conclusion: 提出的渐近展开方法在保持精度的同时大幅降低了计算复杂度，为非线性滤波提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: We propose a new asymptotic expansion method for nonlinear filtering, based
on a small parameter in the system noise. The conditional expectation is
expanded as a power series in the noise level, with each coefficient computed
by solving a system of ordinary differential equations. This approach mitigates
the trade-off between computational efficiency and accuracy inherent in
existing methods such as Gaussian approximations and particle filters.
Moreover, by incorporating an Edgeworth-type expansion, our method captures
complex features of the conditional distribution, such as multimodality, with
significantly lower computational cost than conventional filtering algorithms.

Abstract: In integrated sensing and communications (ISAC), a distinguishing feature of
6G wireless networks, the main challenge lies in integrating the two distinct
functions of sensing and communication within the same waveform. In this paper,
the ISAC waveform synthesis is studied in the wideband regime, since a large
bandwidth can simplify the analysis and is justified by the employment of
millimeter wave or higher frequency band. Standard orthogonal frequency
division multiplexing (OFDM) signaling is assumed, and the wideband analysis of
sensing is a counterpart of the existing studies on wideband communications. It
is proposed that the phase over such OFDM subcarriers is for modulating
communication messages while the power spectral density (PSD) is shaped for the
sensing performance. Beyond OFDM, we further reveal a duality between the
proposed PSD-shaping rule and the orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS)
waveform. Flattening the OTFS delay-axis PSD produces the same integrated
sidelobe level (ISL) reduction effect in the delay-Doppler domain as PSD
control achieves for OFDM in the frequency domain. To balance communication and
sensing performance over frequency-selective channels, we propose a
low-complexity, water-filling-like allocator with an explicit PSD-flatness
(variance) constraint. The performance of the proposed wideband ISAC scheme is
demonstrated using both numerical simulations and hardware experiments.

Abstract: Bladder pressure monitoring systems are increasingly vital in diagnosing and
managing urinary tract dysfunction. Existing solutions rely heavily on
hand-crafted features and shallow classifiers, limiting their adaptability to

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了Uni-NTFM，一种基于神经科学原理设计的统一神经拓扑基础模型，通过解耦架构、拓扑嵌入机制和专家混合Transformer来克服现有脑基础模型在处理EEG信号时的三个主要限制。


<details>

Motivation: 现有基于文本或图像架构的脑基础模型在处理EEG信号时存在三个问题：1) 将时域波形和频域节律特征混在一个处理流中；2) 忽略电极空间拓扑结构；3) 使用不灵活的密集网络处理功能不同的EEG模式。

Conclusion: Uni-NTFM展示了学习大脑活动通用表示的卓越能力，为EEG信号处理提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Foundation models pretrained on various and unlabeled data have demonstrated
significant success in natural language and vision, but their application to
electroencephalography (EEG) remains challenged due to the signal's unique
properties. Existing brain foundation models that inherit architectures
designed for text or images lead to three limitations in pre-training: 1)
conflating time-domain waveform patterns with frequency-domain rhythmic
features in a single processing stream, 2) ignoring the critical spatial
topology of electrodes with different standards, and 3) reliance on the
inflexible, dense network to process functionally distinct EEG patterns. To
address these challenges, we introduce the Unified Neural Topological
Foundation Model (Uni-NTFM), which is designed based on neuroscience principles
to produce universal and interpretable representations. Uni-NTFM integrates
three core innovations: 1) a decoupled architecture parallelly encodes time,
frequency, and raw signal representations before performing cross-domain
feature integration; 2) a topological embedding mechanism to unify electrodes
from different international standards and generate structured input sequences
for brain regions; and 3) a Mixture-of-Experts neural Transformer that
efficiently scales model capacity by routing signal patterns to specialized
subnetworks. The largest model, Uni-NTFM$_{large}$, has a record-breaking 1.9B
parameters and was pretrained on over 28,000 hours of diverse EEG data via a
dual-domain masked reconstruction objective. Uni-NTFM significantly outperforms
existing task-specific methods and foundation models across nine distinct
downstream tasks under both linear probing and fine-tuning settings,
demonstrating a superior ability to learn universal representations of brain
activity.

Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS), capable of dynamically controlling
wireless propagation characteristics using reflecting antenna elements, is a
promising technology for enhancing signal coverage and improving end-user
connectivity in next-generation wireless networks. This paper presents a
complete design flow of a modular RIS prototype operating at the n78 frequency
band, starting from the simulations to the prototype development and testing.
An RIS prototype includes one master and up to sixteen slave blocks, each of
which has an identical hardware structure with $8\times 8$ reflecting surface
elements and a controller board. The phase shift response of each unit element
is controlled with a PIN diode to form a $180^\circ$ phase difference between
the ON and OFF states. The measurement experiment using two RIS blocks, horn
antennas, and a vector network analyzer showed that the improvement of the
received signal power is more than $15$ dB across the n78 frequency band for a
given placement.

Abstract: The problem of recovering a mixture of spike signals convolved with distinct
point spread functions (PSFs) lying on a parametric manifold, under the
assumption that the spike locations are known, is studied. The PSF unmixing
problem is formulated as a projected non-linear least squares estimator. A
lower bound on the radius of the region of strong convexity is established in
the presence of noise as a function of the manifold coherence and Lipschitz
properties, guaranteeing convergence and stability of the optimization program.
Numerical experiments highlight the speed of decay of the PSF class in the
problem's conditioning and confirm theoretical findings. Finally, the proposed
estimator is deployed on real-world spectroscopic data from laser-induced
breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS), removing the need for manual calibration and
validating the method's practical relevance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决无线多端口传感中当可访问天线的独立测量数量不足时，无法准确恢复被测设备特性的问题。

Method: 使用可调负载网络构建可编程夹具，通过多个夹具实现提供测量多样性，实现多路去嵌入。

Result: 实验成功通过30个不同夹具实现，仅使用两个可访问天线间的单一传输系数测量，远程估计了具有10个复值未知数的4端口被测设备的散射矩阵。

Conclusion: 多路去嵌入方法为在RFID和无线生物电子等领域实现低硬件复杂度的无线多端口传感铺平了道路。

Abstract: Wireless multi-port sensing remotely retrieves the scattering matrix of a
multi-port device under test (DUT) connected to a set of
not-directly-accessible (NDA) antennas that couple over-the-air (OTA) to a set
of accessible antennas. If (i) the OTA fixture characteristics are known, and
(ii) the number of independent measurements at the accessible antennas is
sufficient, the OTA fixture can be de-embedded to recover the DUT
characteristics. In recent prior work, we solved (i) by connecting the NDA
antennas to a specific known tunable load network (TLN). Here, we tackle (ii)
by additionally using the TLN to provide measurement diversity. The connection
between OTA fixture and TLN constitutes a programmable fixture (PF). When the
DUT characteristics cannot be identified based on a single PF realization, we
add measurement diversity with multiple PF realizations. The underlying
"multiplexed de-embedding" achieves the joint de-embedding of an ensemble of PF
realizations when a single PF realization cannot be de-embedded. We
experimentally demonstrate our concept by remotely estimating the scattering
matrix of a reciprocal, non-unitary 4-port DUT (10 complex-valued unknowns) via
a rich-scattering OTA fixture purely based on measurements of a single
transmission coefficient between two accessible antennas across 30 different PF
realizations. We systematically study the trade-off between the number of
independent measurements at the accessible antennas and the number of PF
realizations. Multiplexed de-embedding of the OTA fixture paves the path to
implementing wireless multi-port sensing with low hardware complexity in areas
like RFID and wireless bioelectronics.

Result: 真实数据评估显示，BARProp定位精度更高，收敛速度比现有方法快4倍以上，内存使用减少85%。

Conclusion: BARProp为RSS室内定位提供了一种高效实用的解决方案，特别适合资源受限的低成本设备。

Abstract: Leveraging received signal strength (RSS) measurements for indoor
localization is highly attractive due to their inherent availability in
ubiquitous wireless protocols. However, prevailing RSS-based methods often
depend on complex computational algorithms or specialized hardware, rendering
them impractical for low-cost access points. To address these challenges, this
paper introduces buffer-aided RMSProp (BARProp), a fast and memory-efficient
localization algorithm specifically designed for RSS-based tasks. The key
innovation of BARProp lies in a novel mechanism that dynamically adapts the
decay factor by monitoring the energy variations of recent gradients stored in
a buffer, thereby achieving both accelerated convergence and enhanced
stability. Furthermore, BARProp requires less than 15% of the memory used by
state-of-the-art methods. Extensive evaluations with real-world data
demonstrate that BARProp not only achieves higher localization accuracy but
also delivers at least a fourfold improvement in convergence speed compared to
existing benchmarks.

Abstract: Optimizing sensor readout schemes and integrated circuit designs for both
open-loop and closed-loop implementations requires precise modeling and
simulation strategies. This study introduces a novel two-port impedance model
to estimate the behavior of a converse Magnetoelectric (cME) sensor. This model
provides a possible framework for calculating transfer functions and simulating
magnetometer behavior in both continuous- and discrete-time simulation
environments, and it is also possibly transferable to other magnetometer types.
Common S-parameters were measured experimentally using an impedance analyzer
and converted to Z-parameters to create a transfer function for system-level
simulations. The model was validated through an analysis of output-related
noise using MATLAB and LTSpice simulations to optimize the noise of the analog
circuit parts of the system. The simulation results were compared with
experimental measurements using a Zurich Instruments lock-in amplifier and the
custom-designed low-noise printed circuit board (PCB) under model
considerations. The proposed methodology derives noise considerations and the
transfer function of a magnetometer. These are essential for readout schemes
for mixed-signal circuit design. This allows low-noise electronics to be
designed and extended to other sensor interface electronics, broadening their
applicability in high-performance magnetic sensing.

Method: 扩展信息论框架，利用高斯假设绘制帕累托曲面，同时优化压缩效率、失真度和信号可区分性三个特征。

Result: 通过移动帕累托曲面上的点，可以比单纯依赖最优率失真压缩更好地管理这三个特征之间的权衡。

Conclusion: 提出的框架能够同时优化压缩效率、失真度和信号可区分性，比传统仅关注率失真最优的压缩方法更有效地支持异常检测任务。

Abstract: Extensive monitoring systems generate data that is usually compressed for
network transmission. This compressed data might then be processed in the cloud
for tasks such as anomaly detection. However, compression can potentially
impair the detector's ability to distinguish between regular and irregular
patterns due to information loss. Here we extend the information-theoretic
framework introduced in [1] to simultaneously address the trade-off between the
three features on which the effectiveness of the system depends: the
effectiveness of compression, the amount of distortion it introduces, and the
distinguishability between compressed normal signals and compressed anomalous
signals. We leverage a Gaussian assumption to draw curves showing how moving on
a Pareto surface helps administer such a trade-off better than simply relying
on optimal rate-distortion compression and hoping that compressed signals can
be distinguished from each other.

Conclusion: 该工作集成了高保真电磁仿真、生成建模和AI驱动优化，为复杂隧道环境中的下一代CBTC系统提供了可扩展且数据高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Urban railway systems increasingly rely on communication based train control
(CBTC) systems, where optimal deployment of access points (APs) in tunnels is
critical for robust wireless coverage. Traditional methods, such as empirical
model-based optimization algorithms, are hindered by excessive measurement
requirements and suboptimal solutions, while machine learning (ML) approaches
often struggle with complex tunnel environments. This paper proposes a deep
reinforcement learning (DRL) driven framework that integrates parabolic wave
equation (PWE) channel modeling, conditional generative adversarial network
(cGAN) based data augmentation, and a dueling deep Q network (Dueling DQN) for
AP placement optimization. The PWE method generates high-fidelity path loss
distributions for a subset of AP positions, which are then expanded by the cGAN
to create high resolution path loss maps for all candidate positions,
significantly reducing simulation costs while maintaining physical accuracy. In
the DRL framework, the state space captures AP positions and coverage, the
action space defines AP adjustments, and the reward function encourages signal
improvement while penalizing deployment costs. The dueling DQN enhances
convergence speed and exploration exploitation balance, increasing the
likelihood of reaching optimal configurations. Comparative experiments show
that the proposed method outperforms a conventional Hooke Jeeves optimizer and
traditional DQN, delivering AP configurations with higher average received
power, better worst-case coverage, and improved computational efficiency. This
work integrates high-fidelity electromagnetic simulation, generative modeling,
and AI-driven optimization, offering a scalable and data-efficient solution for
next-generation CBTC systems in complex tunnel environments.

Motivation: 传统穷举搜索方法在连续相位偏移下寻找最优码字计算量大且耗时，特别是在毫米波MIMO系统中考虑视距和多径效应时，需要更高效的预编码方案。

Method: 采用训练好的深度神经网络(DNN)进行码字选择，替代计算密集型的穷举搜索方法，同时考虑了离散傅里叶变换向量和幅度响应来设计码本。

Result: 仿真结果表明，DNN方法在测试阶段即使终端用户与RIS之间距离发生变化，仍能保持接近最优的频谱效率。

Conclusion: DNN在RIS辅助系统中具有巨大潜力，能够显著降低计算复杂度同时保持系统性能。

Abstract: In this paper, the precoding design is investigated for maximizing the
throughput of millimeter wave (mmWave) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)
systems with obstructed direct communication paths. In particular, a
reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is employed to enhance MIMO
transmissions, considering mmWave characteristics related to line-of-sight
(LoS) and multipath effects. The traditional exhaustive search (ES) for optimal
codewords in the continuous phase shift is computationally intensive and
time-consuming. To reduce computational complexity, permuted discrete Fourier
transform (DFT) vectors are used for finding codebook design, incorporating
amplitude responses for practical or ideal RIS systems. However, even if the
discrete phase shift is adopted in the ES, it results in significant
computation and is time-consuming. Instead, the trained deep neural network
(DNN) is developed to facilitate faster codeword selection. Simulation results
show that the DNN maintains sub-optimal spectral efficiency even as the
distance between the end-user and the RIS has variations in the testing phase.
These results highlight the potential of DNN in advancing RIS-aided systems.

Conclusion: 基础模型在成人ECG分析中有潜力，但在心脏结构、结果预测和患者特征化方面仍有差距，ECG-CPC的成功显示了改进ECG基础模型的机会。

Abstract: The 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) is a long-standing diagnostic tool. Yet
machine learning for ECG interpretation remains fragmented, often limited to
narrow tasks or datasets. Foundation models promise broader adaptability, but
their generalization across diverse ECG tasks is not well understood. We
benchmarked eight ECG foundation models on 26 clinically relevant tasks using
12 public datasets comprising 1,650 regression and classification targets.
Models were evaluated under fine-tuning and frozen settings, with scaling
analyses across dataset sizes. Results show heterogeneous performance across
domains: in the most widely studied domain, adult ECG interpretation, three
foundation models consistently outperformed strong supervised baselines. In
contrast, ECG-CPC, a compact structured state-space model pretrained on HEEDB,
dominated other categories where most foundation models failed to surpass
supervised learning. Foundation models also displayed distinct scaling
behaviors with dataset size, which are critical for small-scale clinical
applications. Overall, while foundation models show promise for adult ECG
analysis, substantial gaps remain in cardiac structure, outcome prediction, and
patient characterization. Notably, ECG-CPC's strong performance despite being
orders of magnitude smaller and consuming minimal computational resources
highlights untapped opportunities for advancing ECG foundation models.

Abstract: The service rate region of a coded distributed storage system is the set of
all achievable data access requests under the capacity constraints. This paper
investigates the service rate regions of systematic Hamming codes using
hypergraph theory and derives bounds for the maximal achievable service rate of

of data symbols indexed by a subset of systematic nodes in a systematic binary
Hamming code, and explore the achievability of these bounds. Additionally, for
non-systematic binary Hamming codes, we conclude that the aggregate service
rate is limited by the number of columns of odd weight in the associated
generator matrix.

Conclusion: 多头有限状态维度是有限状态维度的有效推广，头数增加确实带来更强的计算能力，但固定头数的预维度在结构稳定性方面存在局限性。

Abstract: We introduce multihead finite-state dimension, a generalization of
finite-state dimension in which a group of finite-state agents (the heads) with
oblivious, one-way movement rules, each reporting only one symbol at a time,
enable their leader to bet on subsequent symbols in an infinite data stream. In
aggregate, such a scheme constitutes an $h$-head finite state gambler whose
maximum achievable growth rate of capital in this task, quantified using
betting strategies called gales, determines the multihead finite-state
dimension of the sequence. The 1-head case is equivalent to finite-state
dimension as defined by Dai, Lathrop, Lutz and Mayordomo (2004). In our main
theorem, we prove a strict hierarchy as the number of heads increases, giving
an explicit sequence family that separates, for each positive integer $h$, the
earning power of $h$-head finite-state gamblers from that of $(h+1)$-head
finite-state gamblers. We prove that multihead finite-state dimension is stable
under finite unions but that the corresponding quantity for any fixed number
$h>1$ of heads--the $h$-head finite-state predimension--lacks this stability
property.

TL;DR: 本文重新研究了zigzag阵列码，为其增加了小域大小和低跳过成本两个新特性，使该MDS码在实际分布式存储系统中更加实用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Zigzag码虽然具有最优访问和最优重建比，但在实际应用中受到域大小依赖和跳过成本的限制。本文旨在解决这些问题，使zigzag码在理论和实践上都更加灵活实用。

Method: 1) 使用Z_2^m作为行索引群，在特征为二的域上构造MDS码；2) 引入排序-子群框架，实现有界跳过成本和低修复碎片比的修复传输方案。

Result: 构建了零跳过成本且码率接近2/3的码族，以及有界跳过成本且码率接近3/4和4/5的码族，这些码率与实践中广泛部署的MDS阵列码相当。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，zigzag码可以在保持最优访问和最优重建比的同时，实现更小的域大小和更低的跳过成本，使其在现代分布式存储系统中更加实用。

Abstract: We revisit zigzag array codes, a family of MDS codes known for achieving
optimal access and optimal rebuilding ratio in single-node repair. In this
work, we endow zigzag codes with two new properties: small field size and low
skip cost. First, we prove that when the row-indexing group is $\mathcal{G} =
\mathbb{Z}_2^m$ and the field has characteristic two, explicit coefficients
over any field with $|\mathcal{F}|\ge N$ guarantee the MDS property, thereby
decoupling the dependence among $p$, $k$, and $M$. Second, we introduce an
ordering-and-subgroup framework that yields repair-by-transfer schemes with
bounded skip cost and low repair-fragmentation ratio (RFR), while preserving
optimal access and optimal rebuilding ratio. Our explicit constructions include
families with zero skip cost whose rates approach $2/3$, and families with
bounded skip cost whose rates approach $3/4$ and $4/5$. These rates are
comparable to those of MDS array codes widely deployed in practice. Together,
these results demonstrate that zigzag codes can be made both more flexible in
theory and more practical for modern distributed storage systems.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种在单基站SISO系统中，通过结合可重构智能表面和多快照利用来实现三维位置和速度联合估计的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在单基站系统中，仅依靠单个RIS或多个快照无法实现3D位置和速度联合估计，需要结合两者来解决这一可行性问题。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：第一阶段通过张量分解将3D联合离开角和多普勒频移估计分解为两个可处理子问题，使用低复杂度交替优化；第二阶段基于信道参数估计，通过差分测量线性方程获得粗估计，再用原始测量进行迭代精化。

Conclusion: 通过RIS部署与多快照利用的结合，成功实现了单基站SISO系统中的3D位置和速度联合估计，所提方法具有统计效率和接近理论极限的性能。

Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) panels can act as cost-effective
anchors for radio localization, complementing conventional base station (BS)
anchors. This paper investigates joint three-dimensional position and velocity
estimation (3D-JPVE) in single-input single-output (SISO) systems with only one
BS available. We first theoretically show that 3D-JPVE is infeasible when
relying solely on a single RIS or on multiple snapshots alone. To address this,
we propose combining RIS deployment with multi-snapshot utilization to enable
realizable 3D-JPVE. A two-stage method is developed for multi-snapshot channel
parameter estimation, comprising a tensor-based coarse estimation step followed
by a maximum likelihood refinement step. In particular, we introduce a
third-order tensor formulation to decompose the challenging 3D joint
angle-of-departure and Doppler shift estimation (3D-JADE) into two tractable
subproblems, which are jointly solved via a low-complexity alternating
optimization approach. Building on the channel parameter estimates, we further
design a two-stage low-complexity method for optimal 3D-JPVE: coarse estimation
is obtained from differential measurements through linear equations, and the
preliminary results are refined iteratively using the original measurements.
Moreover, we derive the closed-form Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) and show that
the proposed 3D-JPVE method approaches CRLB-level accuracy. Simulation results
confirm the statistical efficiency of the proposed estimators and demonstrate
substantial 3D-JPVE performance gains when deploying active RIS compared to
passive RIS.

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 该论文研究了RIS辅助的XL-MIMO下行系统，为近场和远场用户提供通信服务，提出了三种预编码方案和相位设计算法，显著提升了系统性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决XL-MIMO系统中远场用户因遮挡导致的通信问题，通过RIS辅助和智能预编码设计来提升系统频谱效率和用户公平性。

Method: 采用CZF、LZF和MRT三种预编码方案，提出启发式可见区域选择算法降低复杂度，设计两阶段相位偏移和功率控制算法优化加权最小频谱效率。

Result: 相比等功率分配和随机相位设计，所提方案将加权最小频谱效率之和分别提升了31.9%(CZF)、37.8%(LZF)和119.2%(MRT)。CZF性能最佳，LZF复杂度更低。

Conclusion: CZF在平衡性能方面表现最佳，LZF在复杂度与性能间取得良好折衷，MRT在特定场景下也有显著提升，为RIS辅助XL-MIMO系统提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: We consider a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted extremely
large-scale multiple-input multiple-output (XL-MIMO) downlink system, where an
XL-MIMO array serves two groups of single-antennas users, namely near-field
users (NFUEs) and far-field users (FFUEs). FFUEs are subject to blockage, and
their communication is facilitated through the RIS. We consider three precoding
schemes at the XL-MIMO array, namely central zero-forcing (CZF), local
zero-forcing (LZF) and maximum ratio transmission (MRT). Closed-form
expressions for the spectral efficiency (SE) of all users are derived for MRT
precoding, while statistical-form expressions are obtained for CZF and LZF
processing. A heuristic visibility region (VR) selection algorithm is also
introduced to help reduce the computational complexity of the precoding scheme.
Furthermore, we devise a two-stage phase shifts design and power control
algorithm to maximize the sum of weighted minimum SE of two groups of users
with CZF, LZF and MRT precoding schemes. The simulation results indicate that,
when equal priority is given to NFUEs and FFUEs, the proposed design improves
the sum of the weighted minimum SE by 31.9\%, 37.8\%, and 119.2\% with CZF,
LZF, and MRT, respectively, compared to the case with equal power allocation
and random phase shifts design. CZF achieves the best performance, while LZF
offers comparable results with lower complexity. When prioritizing NFUEs or
FFUEs, LZF achieves strong performance for the prioritized group, whereas CZF
ensures balanced performance between NFUEs and FFUEs.

Method: 使用吸收马尔可夫链精确建模离散时间双队列状态更新系统，考虑GAW状态更新、DPH型分布服务时间和传输冻结机制。

Result: 传输冻结策略被证明对各种服务时间分布都能显著降低平均AoI，并分析了服务时间统计参数和服务器异质性对冻结增益的影响。

Conclusion: 在双队列系统中引入传输冻结策略能有效降低信息年龄，特别是在优化冻结策略下可获得显著的AoI减少增益。

Abstract: Status update systems require the timely collection of sensing information
for which deploying multiple sensors/servers to obtain diversity gains is
considered as a promising solution. In this work, we construct an absorbing
Markov chain (AMC) to exactly model Age of Information (AoI) in a discretetime
dual-queue (DTDQ) status update system with generate at will (GAW) status
updates, discrete phase-type (DPH-type) distributed service times and
transmission freezing. Specifically, transmission is frozen for a certain
number of slots following the initiation of a transmission, after which one of
the two servers is allowed to simultaneously sample the monitored physical
process and transmit a status update packet, according to the availabilities
and priorities of the two servers. Based on the discrete-time AMC, we provide
the exact distributions of both AoI and peak AoI (PAoI), enabling the
derivation of arbitrary order moments. In addition, we analytically study the
role of freezing using several typical service time distributions, including
geometric, uniform, and triangular distributions. The introduction of freezing
for DTDQ systems is demonstrated to be significantly beneficial in reducing the
mean AoI for various service time distributions. Additionally, we study the
impact of the statistical parameters of the service times and heterogeneity
between the two servers on the freezing gain, i.e., reduction in mean AoI
attained with optimum freezing policies.

Abstract: In this study, we propose a novel three-user noise-domain non-orthogonal

dimension besides mean and variance quantities used in two-user ND-NOMA. The
new three-user ND-NOMA scheme includes both uplink and downlink scenarios, with
detectors designed to decode the information embedded in mean, variance, and
correlation. Our theoretical analysis and simulation results under Rician

bit error rate (BER) performance while preserving the low power and low
complexity advantages of ND-NOMA. This new ND-NOMA design enables simultaneous
communication among three users using different dimensions, paving the way for
scalable multi-user communication in noise-domain systems and in the
Internet-of-things (IoT) environments.

Conclusion: 基于零空间的设计方法在分布式计算线性可分函数问题上实现了最优或接近最优的性能，通过揭示零空间与稀疏矩阵分解的对偶性，为分布式计算提供了新的理论基础和优化框架。

Abstract: This work addresses the problem of distributed computation of linearly
separable functions, where a master node with access to $K$ datasets, employs
$N$ servers to compute $L$ user-requested functions, each defined over the
datasets. Servers are instructed to compute subfunctions of the datasets and
must communicate computed outputs to the user, who reconstructs the requested
outputs. The central challenge is to reduce the per-server computational load
and the communication cost from servers to the user, while ensuring recovery
for any possible set of $L$ demanded functions.
  We here establish the fundamental communication-computation tradeoffs for
arbitrary $K$ and $L$, through novel task-assignment and communication
strategies that, under the linear-encoding and no-subpacketization assumptions,
are proven to be either exactly optimal or within a factor of three from the
optimum. In contrast to prior approaches that relied on fixed assignments of
tasks -- either disjoint or cyclic assignments -- our key innovation is a
nullspace-based design that jointly governs task assignment and server
transmissions, ensuring exact decodability for all demands, and attaining
optimality over all assignment and delivery methods. To prove this optimality,
we here uncover a duality between nullspaces and sparse matrix factorizations,
enabling us to recast the distributed computing problem as an equivalent
factorization task and derive a sharp information-theoretic converse bound.
Building on this, we establish an additional converse that, for the first time,
links the communication cost to the covering number from the theory of general
covering designs.

Conclusion: 该RSMA传输方案结合无人机基站优化部署，能够有效提升灾后应急通信系统的性能，为地面用户提供更公平可靠的服务。

Abstract: This paper proposes a rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) transmission
scheme to maximize the minimum achievable rate among ground users for emergency
communications in post-disaster scenarios with obstacles, with which the
optimal positioning of multiple unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled base
stations can be achieved timely.To address the resulting non-convex and
intractable optimization problem, we design an alternating optimization
approach. Specifically, we relax obstacle-related constraints using penalty
terms. In each iteration, block coordinate descent (BCD) and successive convex
approximation (SCA) are applied alternately to obtain locally optimal
solutions, and penalty multipliers are updated to ensure convergence of the
relaxed problem to the original one. Simulation results demonstrate that the
proposed scheme significantly outperforms benchmark methods in terms of the
minimum achievable rate, verifying its effectiveness and superiority.

Conclusion: 该研究为DNA存储中的插入错误问题提供了理论分析和实用解决方案，通过确定编码容量和构建最优纠错码，显著提升了DNA存储的可靠性。

Abstract: DNA storage has emerged as a promising solution for large-scale and long-term
data preservation. Among various error types, insertions are the most frequent
errors occurring in DNA sequences, where the inserted symbol is often identical
or complementary to the original, and in practical implementations, noise can
further cause the inserted symbol to mutate into a random one, which creates
significant challenges to reliable data recovery. In this paper, we investigate
a new noisy insertion channel, where infinitely many insertions of symbols
complement or identical to the original ones and up to one insertion of random
symbol may occur. We determine the coding capacity of the noisy channel and
construct asymptotically optimal error-correcting codes achieving the coding
capacity.

Abstract: Massive connectivity with ultra-low latency and high reliability necessitates
fundamental advances in future communication networks operating under
finite-blocklength (FBL) transmission. Fluid antenna systems (FAS) have emerged
as a promising enabler, offering superior spectrum and energy efficiency in
short-packet/FBL scenarios. In this work, by leveraging the simplicity and
accuracy of block-correlation channel modeling, we rigorously bound the
performance limits of FBL-FAS from a statistical perspective, focusing on two
key performance metrics: block error rate (BLER) and outage probability (OP).
Furthermore, we introduce a novel complex-integral simplification method based
on Gauss-Laguerre quadrature, which achieves higher approximation accuracy
compared to existing Taylor-expansion-based approaches. Numerical results
validate the robustness of the proposed analysis and clearly demonstrate the
superiority of FBL-FAS over conventional multiple-antenna systems with fixed

Abstract: The development of 6G wireless systems is taking place alongside the
development of increasingly intelligent wireless devices and network nodes. The
changing technological landscape is motivating a rethinking of classical
Shannon information theory that emphasizes semantic and task-oriented
paradigms. In this paper, we study a prediction-powered communication setting,
in which devices, equipped with artificial intelligence (AI)-based predictors,
communicate under zero-delay constraints with strict distortion guarantees. Two
classes of distortion measures are considered: (i) outage-based metrics,
suitable for tasks tolerating occasional packet losses, such as real-time
control or monitoring; and (ii) bounded distortion metrics, relevant to
semantic-rich tasks like text or video transmission. We propose two zero-delay
compression algorithms leveraging online conformal prediction to provide
per-sequence guarantees on the distortion of reconstructed sequences over
error-free and packet-erasure channels with feedback. For erasure channels, we
introduce a doubly-adaptive conformal update to compensate for channel-induced
errors and derive sufficient conditions on erasure statistics to ensure
distortion constraints. Experiments on semantic text compression validate the
approach, showing significant bit rate reductions while strictly meeting
distortion guarantees compared to state-of-the-art prediction-powered
compression methods.

Abstract: Movable antennas (MAs) offer additional spatial degrees of freedom (DoFs) to
enhance communication performance through local antenna movement. However, to
achieve accurate and fast antenna movement, MA drivers entail non-negligible
mechanical power consumption, rendering energy efficiency (EE) optimization
more critical compared to conventional fixed-position antenna (FPA) systems. To
address this issue, we develop a fundamental power consumption model for
stepper motor-driven multi-MA systems based on electric motor theory. Based on
this model, we formulate an EE maximization problem from a multi-MA base
station (BS) to multiple single-FPA users. We aim to jointly optimize the MAs'
positions, moving speeds, and the BS's transmit precoding matrix subject to
collision-avoidance constraints during the multi-MA movements. However, this
problem is difficult to solve. To tackle this challenge, we first reveal that
the collision-avoidance constraints can always be relaxed without loss of
optimality by properly renumbering the MA indices. For the resulting relaxed
problem, we first consider a simplified single-user setup and uncover a hidden
monotonicity of the EE performance with respect to the MAs' moving speeds. To
solve the remaining optimization problem, we develop a two-layer optimization
framework. In the inner layer, the Dinkelbach algorithm is employed to derive
the optimal beamforming solution for any given MA positions. In the outer
layer, a sequential update algorithm is proposed to iteratively refine the MA
positions based on the optimal values obtained from the inner layer. Next, we
proceed to the general multi-user case and propose an alternating optimization
(AO) algorithm. Numerical results demonstrate that despite the additional
mechanical power consumption, the proposed algorithms can outperform both
conventional FPA systems and other existing EE maximization benchmarks

Abstract: A class of splitting alternating algorithms is proposed for finding the
sparse solution of linear systems with concatenated orthogonal matrices.
Depending on the number of matrices concatenated, the proposed algorithms are
classified into the two-block splitting alternating algorithm (TSAA) and the
multi-block splitting alternating algorithm (MSAA). These algorithms aim to
decompose a large-scale linear system into two or more coupled subsystems, each
significantly smaller than the original system, and then combine the solutions
of these subsystems to produce the sparse solution of the original system. The
proposed algorithms only involve matrix-vector products and reduced orthogonal
projections. It turns out that the proposed algorithms are globally convergent
to the sparse solution of a linear system if the matrix (along with the
sparsity level of the solution) satisfies a coherence-type condition. Numerical
experiments indicate that the proposed algorithms are very promising and can
quickly and accurately locate the sparse solution of a linear system with
significantly fewer iterations than several mainstream iterative methods.

$\mathcal{A}:\mathbb{R}^{n\times m}\rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{p}$ is a linear map
and $\boldsymbol{\eta}\in \mathbb{R}^p$ is the noise vector. We first examine
the rank-constrained nonlinear least-squares model $\hat{\mathbf{X}}\in
\mathop{\mathrm{argmin}}\limits_{\substack{\mathbf{X}\in \mathbb{R}^{n\times
m},\mathrm{rank}(\mathbf{X})\le
r}}\||\mathcal{A}(\mathbf{X})|-\mathbf{y}\|_2^2$ to estimate $\mathbf{X}_0$,
and demonstrate that the reconstruction error satisfies
$\min\{\|\hat{\mathbf{X}}-\mathbf{X}_0\|_F,
\|\hat{\mathbf{X}}+\mathbf{X}_0\|_F\}\lesssim
\frac{\|\boldsymbol{\eta}\|_2}{\sqrt{p}}$ with high probability, provided
$\mathcal{A}$ is a Gaussian measurement ensemble and $p\gtrsim (m+n)r$. We also
prove that the error bound $\frac{\|\boldsymbol{\eta}\|_2}{\sqrt{p}}$ is tight
up to a constant. Furthermore, we relax the rank constraint to a nuclear-norm
constraint. Hence, we propose the Lasso model for low-rank phase retrieval,
i.e., the constrained nuclear-norm model and the unconstrained version. We also
establish comparable theoretical guarantees for these models. To achieve this,
we introduce a strong restricted isometry property (SRIP) for the linear map
$\mathcal{A}$, analogous to the strong RIP in phase retrieval. This work
provides a unified treatment that extends existing results in both phase
retrieval and low-rank matrix recovery from rank-one measurements.

Abstract: Determining the exact decoding error probability of linear block codes is an
interesting problem. For binary BCH codes, McEliece derived methods to estimate
the error probability of a simple bounded distance decoding (BDD) for BCH
codes. However, BDD falls short in many applications. In this work, we consider
error-and-erasure decoding and its variants that improve upon BDD. We derive
closed-form expressions for their error probabilities and validate them through
simulations. Then, we illustrate their use in assessing concatenated coding
schemes.

Abstract: This letter investigates the secrecy performance of wireless communication
systems assisted by a fluid reconfigurable intelligent surface (FRIS). Unlike
conventional reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) with fixed geometries,
FRISs dynamically select a subset of reflective elements based on real-time
channel conditions, offering enhanced spatial diversity and adaptability. Using
this foundation, we model a secure downlink scenario where a base station
communicates with a legitimate user in the presence of an eavesdropper, and the
propagation is assisted by a FRIS with a limited number of elements set to the
ON state. We analyze the system's secrecy performance under spatial correlation
by deriving analytical lower and upper bounds for the secrecy outage
probability (SOP) and average secrecy capacity (ASC), respectively. Our results
demonstrate that FRIS effectively enables secure communication under spatial
correlation. Even with partial activation, FRIS significantly outperforms
conventional RISs in enhancing secrecy performance under varying deployment
densities and element correlations.

Abstract: Hybrid digital and analog beamforming is a highly effective technique for
implementing beamforming methods in millimeter wave (mmWave) systems. It
provides a viable solution to replace the complex fully digital beamforming
techniques. However, the current design of precoding and combining matrices in
hybrid beamforming solely relies on the channel information, neglecting the
crucial consideration of the structure of covariance matrices of the transmit
signals. In this paper, we present a novel approach for the joint design of
hybrid beamforming matrices at the transmitter and receiver. This approach is
centered around the optimization of the covariance matrix of the transmitted
signals. Our goal is to maximize the downlink sum rate capacity of the system
by achieving an optimal design of the transmit covariance matrix. We tackle the
non-convex nature of this problem by leveraging the dual relationship between
the broadcast channel (BC) and the multiple access channel (MAC). Through
extensive simulations in various scenarios, including point-to-point
multi-input multi-output (MIMO), multi-user (MU) multi-input single-output
(MISO), and MU-MIMO, we demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method over
traditional designs. These results highlight the effectiveness and versatility
of our approach in optimizing beamforming for mmWave systems.

Abstract: Current wireless networks are designed to optimize spectral efficiency for
human users, who typically require sustained connections for high-data-rate
applications like file transfers and video streaming. However, these networks
are increasingly inadequate for the emerging era of machine-type communications
(MTC). With a vast number of devices exhibiting sporadic traffic patterns
consisting of short packets, the grant-based multiple access procedures
utilized by existing networks lead to significant delays and inefficiencies. To
address this issue the unsourced random access (URA) paradigm has been
proposed. This paradigm assumes the devices to share a common encoder thus
simplifying the reception process by eliminating the identification procedure.
The URA paradigm not only addresses the computational challenges but it also
considers the random access (RA) as a coding problem, i.e., takes into account
both medium access protocols and physical layer effects. In this monograph we
provide a comprehensive overview of the URA problem in noisy channels, with the
main task being to explain the major ideas rather than to list all existing
solutions.
