  <summary>Details</summary>

Abstract: Stochastic resonance (SR), a phenomenon originally introduced in climate
modeling, enhances signal detection by leveraging optimal noise levels within
non-linear systems. Traditional SR techniques, mainly based on single-threshold
detectors, are limited to signals whose behavior does not depend on time. Often
large amounts of noise are needed to detect weak signals, which can distort
complex signal characteristics. To address these limitations, this study
explores multi-threshold systems and the application of SR in multiscale
applications using wavelet transforms. In the multiscale domain signals can be
analyzed at different levels of resolution to better understand the underlying
dynamics.
  We propose a double-threshold detection system that integrates two
single-threshold detectors to enhance weak signal detection. We evaluate it
both in the original data domain and in the multiscale domain using simulated
and real-world signals and compare its performance with existing methods.
  Experimental results demonstrate that, in the original data domain, the
proposed double-threshold detector significantly improves weak signal detection
compared to conventional single-threshold approaches. Its performance is
further improved in the frequency domain, requiring lower noise levels while
outperforming existing detection systems. This study advances SR-based
detection methodologies by introducing a robust approach to weak signal
identification, with potential applications in various disciplines.

### [2] [Is Repeater-Assisted Massive MIMO Compatible with Dynamic TDD?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20998)
*Martin Andersson,Anubhab Chowdhury,Erik G. Larsson*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种在动态TDD中继辅助大规模MIMO网络中联合优化中继器增益放大和相移的框架，通过算法校准中继器增益以放大期望信号同时限制干扰。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 中继器作为具有放大和相移功能的有源散射体，能增强用户接收信号强度，但也会放大噪声和干扰信号，特别是在动态TDD系统中由于上下行同时传输会产生交叉链路干扰，需要在期望信号放大和干扰抑制之间进行权衡。

Method: 首先推导下行和上行频谱效率，然后开发用于频谱效率最大化的中继器增益优化算法。

Result: 数值结果表明，所提出的算法成功校准了中继器增益，能够放大期望信号同时限制干扰。

Conclusion: 该框架能够有效解决动态TDD中继网络中期望信号放大与干扰抑制之间的权衡问题，通过优化中继器增益提升系统性能。

Abstract: We present a framework for joint amplification and phase shift optimization
of the repeater gain in dynamic time-division duplex (TDD) repeater-assisted
massive MIMO networks. Repeaters, being active scatterers with amplification
and phase shift, enhance the received signal strengths for users. However, they
inevitably also amplify undesired noise and interference signals, which become
particularly prominent in dynamic TDD systems due to the concurrent downlink
(DL) and uplink (UL) transmissions, introducing cross-link interference among
access points and users operating in opposite transmit directions. This causes
a non-trivial trade-off between amplification of desired and undesired signals.
To underpin the conditions under which such a trade-off can improve
performance, we first derive DL and UL spectral efficiencies (SEs), and then
develop a repeater gain optimization algorithm for SE maximization.
Numerically, we show that our proposed algorithm successfully calibrates the
repeater gain to amplify the desired signal while limiting the interference.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种6D可移动全息表面(6DMHS)集成数据与能量传输系统，通过三阶段协议协调6DMHS，有效服务IDET接收器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 可重构全息表面(RHS)虽然具有成本效益的大规模阵列和高空间增益，但其幅度控制的全息波束成形存在方向波动问题，难以充分利用RHS的空间增益。6D可移动天线(6DMA)为解决这一问题提供了潜在方案。

Method: 提出三阶段协议：上行链路感知阶段、方向调整阶段和下行链路传输阶段。首先利用全息感知技术获取IDET接收器信息；然后固定旋转参数，优化6DMHS的方向和RHS的全息波束成形；最后固定6DMHS方向和全息波束成形，优化数字波束成形、功率分配因子和能量收集功率。

Result: 仿真结果表明，所提方案相比基准方法能够显著提升IDET性能。

Conclusion: 6DMHS集成系统通过协调6D移动性和全息波束成形，能够有效解决RHS的方向波动问题，提升集成数据与能量传输性能。

Abstract: Reconfigurable holographic surface (RHS) enables cost-effective large-scale
arrays with high spatial gain. However, its amplitude-controlled holographic
beamforming suffers from directional fluctuations, making it difficult to fully
exploit the spatial gain of RHS. Fortunately, the promising 6D movable antenna
(6DMA) provides a potential solution to this problem. In this paper, we study a
6D movable holographic surface (6DMHS) integrated data and energy transfer
(IDET) system, where a three-stage protocol is proposed, consisting of an
uplink sensing stage, an orientation adjustment stage and a downlink
transmission stage, to coordinate the 6DMHS and effectively serve the IDET
receivers. Firstly, the holographic-based sensing technology is proposed and
the sensing information of the IDET receivers is exploited. Secondly, by fixing
the rotations with the sensing information, the orientation optimization
problem is formulated for designing the holographic beamforming of the RHS and
adjusting the translations of the 6DMHS. As a result, the directions with
maximum beamforming gain are aligned with each IDET receiver. Thirdly, by
fixing the orientation of the 6DMHS and the holographic beamforming, the
equivalent wireless channel is obtained. The IDET performance optimization
problem is formulated for obtaining the optimal digital beamforming, power
splitting factor and energy harvesting (EH) power. Simulation results
demonstrate that the proposed scheme is capable of improving the IDET
performance compared to the benchmarks.

Abstract: Collective perception is a key aspect for autonomous driving in smart cities
as it aims to combine the local environment models of multiple intelligent
vehicles in order to overcome sensor limitations. A crucial part of
multi-sensor fusion is track-to-track association. Previous works often suffer
from high computational complexity or are based on heuristics. We propose an
association algorithms based on stochastic optimization, which leverages a
multidimensional likelihood incorporating the number of tracks and their
spatial distribution and furthermore computes several association hypotheses.
We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in Monte Carlo simulations and
a realistic collective perception scenario computing high-likelihood
associations in ambiguous settings.

Result: 实验结果表明，时分复用设置呈现基于阈值的结构，频分复用设置呈现双分解结构，验证了理论发现。

Conclusion: 通过建立空中计算误差与推理性能之间的关系，为集成感知与边缘人工智能系统提供了有效的优化框架和设计指导。

Abstract: This work investigates an integrated sensing and edge artificial intelligence
(ISEA) system, where multiple devices first transmit probing signals for target
sensing and then offload locally extracted features to the access point (AP)
via analog over-the-air computation (AirComp) for collaborative inference. To
characterize the relationship between AirComp error and inference performance,
two proxies are established: the \emph{computation-optimal} proxy that
minimizes the aggregation distortion, and the \emph{decision-optimal} proxy
that maximizes the inter-class separability, respectively. Optimal transceiver
designs in terms of closed-form power allocation are derived for both
time-division multiplexing (TDM) and frequency-division multiplexing (FDM)
settings, revealing threshold-based and dual-decomposition structures,
respectively. Experimental results validate the theoretical findings.

Abstract: Weak turbulence is commonly modeled using the log-normal distribution. Our
experimental results show that this distribution fails to capture irradiance
fluctuations in this regime. The Gamma-Gamma model is shown to be more
accurate.

### [7] [Information Theoretic Learning for Diffusion Models with Warm Start](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20903)
*Yirong Shen,Lu Gan,Cong Ling*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 提出一个更紧的似然边界，用于改进基于噪声扰动模型的极大似然学习，支持任意噪声分布而不仅限于高斯假设。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于扰动的似然估计模型虽然实用，但面临收敛慢和理论理解有限的问题，需要改进准确性和效率。

Method: 将经典KL散度与Fisher信息的关系扩展到任意噪声扰动，将扩散过程视为高斯信道，表达数据与模型之间的失配熵。

Result: 在CIFAR-10上获得有竞争力的负对数似然，在ImageNet多个分辨率上达到SOTA结果，无需数据增强。

Conclusion: 提出的框架改进了基于噪声的似然模型的准确性和效率，并能自然扩展到离散数据。

Abstract: Generative models that maximize model likelihood have gained traction in many
practical settings. Among them, perturbation based approaches underpin many
strong likelihood estimation models, yet they often face slow convergence and
limited theoretical understanding. In this paper, we derive a tighter
likelihood bound for noise driven models to improve both the accuracy and
efficiency of maximum likelihood learning. Our key insight extends the
classical KL divergence Fisher information relationship to arbitrary noise
perturbations, going beyond the Gaussian assumption and enabling structured
noise distributions. This formulation allows flexible use of randomized noise
distributions that naturally account for sensor artifacts, quantization
effects, and data distribution smoothing, while remaining compatible with
standard diffusion training. Treating the diffusion process as a Gaussian
channel, we further express the mismatched entropy between data and model,
showing that the proposed objective upper bounds the negative log-likelihood
(NLL). In experiments, our models achieve competitive NLL on CIFAR-10 and SOTA
results on ImageNet across multiple resolutions, all without data augmentation,
and the framework extends naturally to discrete data.

*En-Jui Chang*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 通过重叠少量重复码，将Shor码的渐近码率提高四倍，在最小距离d=3时从[[9,1,3]]优化到[[7,1,3]]配置


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

yielding a simple structure but a relatively low code rate. By overlapping a
small number of repetition codes, we enhance the asymptotic code rate fourfold.
In the minimal-distance case $d = 3$, this construction reduces the overhead

### [9] [Complex DNA Synthesis Sequences](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21253)

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DNA存储具有高密度和耐久性优势，但其可扩展性受限于并行链合成的效率。现有方法要么允许无约束的核苷酸添加，要么强制所有链进行相同添加，需要一种能平衡这两种方法的混合框架。

Result: 建立了约束DNA合成的综合理论框架，统一了先前模型，为未来该领域的进展奠定了基础。推导了最大信息率的紧致表达式及其渐近行为，并开发了有效的动态规划算法。

Conclusion: 该研究填补了约束模型与理想化设置之间的理论空白，提出了一个全面且可扩展的DNA合成理论框架，为大规模DNA存储系统的设计提供了理论基础。

Abstract: DNA-based storage offers unprecedented density and durability, but its
scalability is fundamentally limited by the efficiency of parallel strand
synthesis. Existing methods either allow unconstrained nucleotide additions to
individual strands, such as enzymatic synthesis, or enforce identical additions
across many strands, such as photolithographic synthesis. We introduce and
analyze a hybrid synthesis framework that generalizes both approaches: in each
cycle, a nucleotide is selected from a restricted subset and incorporated in
parallel. This model gives rise to a new notion of a complex synthesis
sequence. Building on this framework, we extend the information rate definition
of Lenz et al. and analyze an analog of the deletion ball, defined and studied
in this setting, deriving tight expressions for the maximal information rate
and its asymptotic behavior. These results bridge the theoretical gap between
constrained models and the idealized setting in which every nucleotide is
always available. For the case of known strands, we design a dynamic
programming algorithm that computes an optimal complex synthesis sequence,
highlighting structural similarities to the shortest common supersequence
problem. We also define a distinct two-dimensional array model with synthesis
constraints over the rows, which extends previous synthesis models in the
literature and captures new structural limitations in large-scale strand
arrays. Additionally, we develop a dynamic programming algorithm for this
problem as well. Our results establish a new and comprehensive theoretical
framework for constrained DNA, subsuming prior models and setting the stage for
future advances in the field.

### [10] [Text-Guided Diffusion Model-based Generative Communication for Wireless Image Transmission](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21299)
*Shengkang Chen,Tong Wu,Zhiyong Chen,Feng Yang,Meixia Tao,Wenjun Zhang*

Main category: cs.IT

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决无线信道中极低传输速率下传统压缩和信道编码方案无法保持足够视觉质量的问题，专注于在严重受限速率下保持语义内容。

Conclusion: 所提框架通过生成先验和语义指导，在极低传输速率下实现了高质量的视觉恢复，为无线图像传输提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Reliable image transmission over wireless channels is particularly
challenging at extremely low transmission rates, where conventional compression
and channel coding schemes fail to preserve adequate visual quality. To address
this issue, we propose a generative communication framework based on diffusion
models, which integrates joint source channel coding (JSCC) with
semantic-guided reconstruction leveraging a pre-trained generative model.
Unlike conventional architectures that aim to recover exact pixel values of the
original image, the proposed method focuses on preserving and reconstructing
semantically meaningful visual content under severely constrained rates,
ensuring perceptual plausibility and faithfulness to the scene intent.
Specifically, the transmitter encodes the source image via JSCC and jointly
transmits it with a textual prompt over the wireless channel. At the receiver,
the corrupted low-rate representation is fused with the prompt and
reconstructed through a Stable Diffusion model with ControlNet, enabling
high-quality visual recovery. Leveraging both generative priors and semantic
guidance, the proposed framework produces perceptually convincing images even
under extreme bandwidth limitations. Experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed method consistently outperforms conventional coding-based schemes and
deep learning baselines, achieving superior perceptual quality and robustness
across various channel conditions.

Abstract: Deep generative models offer a powerful alternative to conventional channel
estimation by learning the complex prior distribution of wireless channels.
Capitalizing on this potential, this paper proposes a novel channel estimation
algorithm based on latent diffusion models (LDMs), termed posterior sampling
with latent diffusion for channel estimation (PSLD-CE). The core of our
approach is a lightweight LDM architecture specifically designed for channel
estimation, which serves as a powerful generative prior to capture the
intricate channel distribution. Furthermore, we enhance the diffusion posterior
sampling process by introducing an effective approximation for the likelihood
term and a tailored self-consistency constraint on the variational autoencoder
latent space. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that PSLD-CE
consistently outperforms a wide range of existing methods. Notably, these
significant performance gains are achieved while maintaining low computational
complexity and fast inference speed, establishing our method as a highly
promising and practical solution for next-generation wireless systems.

### [12] [Universal Maximum Likelihood (List) Decoding via Fast Vector-Matrix Multiplication](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21414)
*Hoang Ly,Emina Soljanin*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 提出了一种通用的最大似然解码框架，将最坏情况下的时间复杂度从q^k n降低到q^k，代价是空间复杂度增加到O(q^{k+1} n)


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统最大似然解码的时间复杂度与穷举搜索相当，为q^k n次操作，这在实践中计算代价过高，需要更高效的解码方法

Method: 通过将码字似然表示为两个向量的内积，将整个码本的似然计算转化为单次向量-矩阵乘法，并使用Mailman算法降低计算成本

Result: 将最坏情况时间复杂度降低了n倍，从q^k n降至q^k，同时该框架适用于线性和非线性分组码、各种无记忆信道以及硬判决和软判决解码

Conclusion: 该框架为最大似然解码提供了显著的复杂度改进，虽然以空间复杂度为代价，但在实践中这种时间-空间权衡是可接受的

Abstract: Maximum-likelihood (ML) decoding for arbitrary block codes remains
fundamentally hard, with worst-case time complexity-measured by the total
number of multiplications-being no better than straightforward exhaustive
search, which requires $q^{k} n$ operations for an $[n,k]_q$ code. This paper
introduces a simple, code-agnostic framework that reduces the worst-case
complexity by a factor of $n$, down to $q^{k}$ operations, a highly desirable
reduction in practice. The result holds for both linear and nonlinear block
codes over general memoryless channels and under both hard-decision and
soft-decision decoding. It naturally extends to intersymbol-interference (ISI)
channels and ML list decoding with only a negligible increase in complexity.
Our core insight is that, upon receipt of each sequence at the receiver, the
conditional probability of that sequence for each codeword in the codebook
(i.e., the \emph{likelihood}) can be expressed as the inner product of two
carefully constructed vectors -- the first depending on the received sequence,
and the second on that codeword itself. As a result, evaluating the likelihoods
for all codewords in the codebook reduces to a single vector-matrix
multiplication, and ML decoding (MLD) becomes the simple task of picking the
maximum entry in the resulting vector. The only non-trivial cost lies in the
vector-matrix product. However, our matrix construction allows the use of the
Mailman algorithm to reduce this cost. This time reduction is achieved at the
cost of high space complexity, requiring $\mathcal{O}(q^{k+1} n)$ space to
store the pre-computed codebook matrix.

Motivation: 5G网络虽然提供高可靠性和可用性，但在面对意外情况时仍可能失效。弹性系统能够适应现实世界的复杂性，包括系统设计时完全未预料到的运行条件，这对缺乏模型或统计保证的通信系统至关重要。

Method: 通过理论分析探讨AI在弹性无线接入网络设计中的挑战，重点关注未预料和罕见中断情况。

Conclusion: AI将在提供网络弹性方面发挥重要作用，但需要超越传统统计学习方法，结合在线学习和因果推断等方法来应对未预料和罕见的中断场景。

Abstract: 5G networks offer exceptional reliability and availability, ensuring
consistent performance and user satisfaction. Yet they might still fail when
confronted with the unexpected. A resilient system is able to adapt to
real-world complexity, including operating conditions completely unanticipated
during system design. This makes resilience a vital attribute for communication
systems that must sustain service in scenarios where models are absent or too
intricate to provide statistical guarantees. Such considerations indicate that
artifical intelligence (AI) will play a major role in delivering resilience. In
this paper, we examine the challenges of designing AIs for resilient radio
access networks, especially with respect to unanticipated and rare disruptions.
Our theoretical results indicate strong limitations of current statistical
learning methods for resilience and suggest connections to online learning and
causal inference.
