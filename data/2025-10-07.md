*Boyang Chen,Mohd Tasleem Khan,George Goussetis,Mathini Sellathurai,Yuan Ding,João F. C. Mota*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: COMET框架通过偏移二进制编码技术优化CNN设计，在FPGA上实现性能与资源利用的协同优化，显著降低资源使用同时保持精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CNN在计算机视觉任务中表现优异，但其计算密集性和对FPGA等硬件的依赖使得在低功耗边缘设备上的部署面临挑战。

Method: 采用偏移二进制编码分别表示输入和权重，利用位宽不对称性；改进移位累加操作；引入四种新型LUT技术；开发基于OBC的通用矩阵乘法核心。

Result: FPGA评估显示，相比最先进的LeNet-5 CNN设计，该方法显著减少了资源利用率，且对精度影响极小。

Conclusion: COMET框架通过硬件友好的偏移二进制编码技术，成功实现了CNN在边缘设备上的高效部署，为低功耗应用提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are highly effective for computer vision
and pattern recognition tasks; however, their computational intensity and
reliance on hardware such as FPGAs pose challenges for deployment on low-power
edge devices. In this work, we present COMET, a framework of CNN designs that
employ efficient hardware offset-binary coding (OBC) techniques to enable
co-optimization of performance and resource utilization. The approach
formulates CNN inference with OBC representations of inputs (Scheme A) and
weights (Scheme B) separately, enabling exploitation of bit-width asymmetry.
The shift-accumulate operation is modified by incorporating the offset term
with the pre-scaled bias. Leveraging inherent symmetries in Schemes A and B, we
introduce four novel look-up table (LUT) techniques -- parallel, shared, split,
and hybrid -- and analyze them to identify the most efficient options. Building
on this foundation, we develop an OBC-based general matrix multiplication core
using the im2col transformation, enabling efficient acceleration of a
fixed-point modified LeNet-5 model. FPGA evaluations demonstrate that the
proposed co-optimization approach significantly reduces resource utilization
compared to state-of-the-art LeNet-5 based CNN designs, with minimal impact on
accuracy.

TL;DR: 将可变块相关模型(VBCM)应用于流体天线系统(FAS)安全分析，开发了新的闭式表达式和优化算法，显著提升了分析精度和系统性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统相关性模型(如Jakes模型)在分析上难以处理，而过度简化的恒定相关模型无法准确捕捉FAS端口的真实空间相关性行为，这给6G无线通信中的FAS安全分析带来了挑战。

Method: 应用可变块相关模型(VBCM)到FAS安全分析，推导了平均保密容量(ASC)和保密中断概率(SOP)的闭式表达式，并设计了网格搜索(GS)和梯度下降(GD)两种优化算法来最大化ASC。

Result: VBCM框架实现了与仿真对齐的精度，相对误差始终低于5%(恒定相关模型为10-15%)。在高威胁场景下ASC提升超过120%，在紧凑天线配置下性能提升18-19%。

Conclusion: 将VBCM集成到FAS安全分析和优化中具有重要实用价值，是推进6G通信系统的有力工具。

Abstract: Fluid antenna systems (FAS) are emerging as a transformative enabler for
sixth-generation (6G) wireless communications, providing unprecedented spatial
diversity through dynamic reconfiguration of antenna ports. However, the
inherent spatial correlation among ports poses significant challenges for
accurate analysis. Conventional models such as Jakes are analytically
intractable, while oversimplified constant-correlation models fail to capture
the true behavior. In this work, we address these challenges by applying the
variable block-correlation model (VBCM) -- originally proposed by
Ram\'{i}rez-Espinosa \textit{et al.} in 2024 -- to FAS security analysis, and
by developing comprehensive optimization methods to enhance analytical
accuracy. We derive new closed-form expressions for average secrecy capacity
(ASC) and secrecy outage probability (SOP), demonstrating that the VBCM
framework achieves simulation-aligned accuracy, with relative errors
consistently below $5\%$ (compared to $10$--$15\%$ for constant-correlation
models). To maximize ASC, we further design two algorithms: a grid search (GS)
method and a gradient descent (GD) method. Numerical results reveal that the
VBCM-based approach not only provides reliable insights into FAS security
performance, but also yields substantial gains -- ASC improvements exceeding
$120\%$ in high-threat scenarios and $18$--$19\%$ performance enhancements for
compact antenna configurations. These findings underscore the practical value
of integrating VBCM into FAS security analysis and optimization, establishing
it as a powerful tool for advancing 6G communication systems.

### [3] [On-Grid Equivalence of Continuous-Time Doubly Selective Channels: A Revisit of Bello's Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03626)
*Jun Tong*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该论文重新审视了实际物理信道的网格建模，研究了具有离网格时延和多普勒频移的双选择性信道的等效网格DD域表示，扩展了Bello的经典结果以考虑更一般的窗函数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的双选择性信道通信研究通常使用网格DD信道模型，但实际物理信道由传播环境决定且通常是离网格的，这导致实际物理信道与网格模型之间存在差距。

Method: 研究连续时间、具有离网格时延和多普勒频移的双选择性信道在收发器采用实际时/频域加窗情况下的等效网格DD域表示，基于窗函数具有有限支撑的温和假设。

Result: 获得了适用于一般窗函数的通用模型，扩展了Bello的经典结果，并讨论了等效网格模型的特征和含义。

Conclusion: 该研究为实际物理信道提供了更准确的网格建模方法，弥合了理论模型与实际信道之间的差距，对双选择性信道通信研究具有重要意义。

Abstract: Significant studies on communications over doubly selective channels have
utilized on-grid DD channel models, which are previously investigated in
Bello's seminar paper in 1963. The DD grid is typically specified by the
bandwidth and time duration of the transmission frames. However, the physical
channels are determined by the propagation environments and they are typically
off-grid. Hence, there is often a gap between an actual physical channel and
the on-grid model. This paper revisits the on-grid modeling of practical
physical channels. We study the associated on-grid DD-domain representations
for continuous-time, doubly selective channels with off-grid delay and Doppler
shifts, accounting for practical time/frequency-domain windowing at the
transceivers. The universal models obtained are applicable under the mild
assumption that the windows have finite supports, and they extend Bello's
classical results to account for more general windows. We also discuss the
features and implications of the equivalent on-grid models.

### [4] [Pinching Antenna Systems (PASS) for Cell-Free Communications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03628)
*Haochen Li*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种夹持天线系统辅助的无蜂窝通信系统，通过交替优化算法解决和速率最大化问题，在基站功率预算和PA部署约束下实现性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决传统蜂窝系统中用户数量增加导致的平均用户速率下降问题，并提升系统性能，提出了夹持天线系统辅助的无蜂窝通信架构。

Method: 使用交替优化算法，其中数字波束赋形子问题采用加权最小均方误差方法解决，夹持波束赋形子问题通过基于惩罚的方法结合逐元素优化处理。

Result: 仿真结果表明：1) PASS辅助的无蜂窝系统性能优于基准方案；2) 增加每个波导的PA数量可提升系统优势；3) 无蜂窝架构缓解了用户数增加时的平均用户速率下降。

Conclusion: PASS辅助的无蜂窝通信系统通过有效的波束赋形优化，在用户容量和系统性能方面展现出显著优势，为未来无线通信提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: A pinching antenna system (PASS) assisted cell-free communication system is
proposed. A sum rate maximization problem under the BS power budget constraint
and PA deployment constraint is formulated. To tackle the proposed non-convex
optimization problem, an alternating optimization (AO) algorithm is developed.
In particular, the digital beamforming sub-problem is solved using the weighted
minimum mean square error (WMMSE) method, whereas the pinching beamforming
sub-problem is handled via a penalty based approach combined with element-wise
optimization. Simulation results demonstrate that: 1) the PASS assisted
cell-free systems achieve superior performance over benchmark schemes; 2)
increasing the number of PAs per waveguides can improve the advantage of PASS
assisted cell-free systems; and 3) the cell-free architecture mitigates the
average user rate degradation as the number of users increases.

### [5] [Towards Secure ISAC Beamforming: How Many Dedicated Sensing Beams Are Required?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03749)
*Fanghao Xia,Zesong Fei,Xinyi Wang,Nanchi Su,Zhaolin Wang,Yuanwei Liu,Jie Xu*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文研究多用户多窃听器ISAC系统中的感知辅助安全通信，通过联合传输通信和感知信号来服务用户并探测空中窃听器，开发了基于分数规划和交替优化的波束成形算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在集成感知与通信系统中，需要同时保障通信性能和感知能力，特别是在存在多个空中窃听器的情况下，如何通过感知辅助实现安全通信是一个重要挑战。

Method: 提出基于分数规划的交替优化算法，使用连续凸近似和半定松弛处理非凸约束，并通过流形优化解决混合模拟数字阵列的单位模约束问题。

Result: 仿真结果表明，仅需少量感知波束即可同时实现感知和干扰窃听器，所提设计在性能上优于现有基线方法，并揭示了通信与感知之间的权衡关系。

Conclusion: 该研究为ISAC系统中的安全通信提供了有效的波束成形设计方案，证明了感知辅助在对抗空中窃听器方面的有效性。

Abstract: In this paper, sensing-assisted secure communication in a multi-user
multi-eavesdropper integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system is
investigated. Confidential communication signals and dedicated sensing signals
are jointly transmitted by a base station (BS) to simultaneously serve users
and sense aerial eavesdroppers (AEs). A sum rate maximization problem is
formulated under AEs' Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio (SINR) and
sensing Signal-to-Clutter-plus-Noise Ratio (SCNR) constraints. A
fractional-programming-based alternating optimization algorithm is developed to
solve this problem for fully digital arrays, where successive convex
approximation (SCA) and semidefinite relaxation (SDR) are leveraged to handle
non-convex constraints. Furthermore, the minimum number of dedicated sensing
beams is analyzed via a worst-case rank bound, upon which the proposed
beamforming design is further extended to the hybrid analog-digital (HAD) array
architecture, where the unit-modulus constraint is addressed by manifold
optimization. Simulation results demonstrate that only a small number of
sensing beams are sufficient for both sensing and jamming AEs, and the proposed
designs consistently outperform strong baselines while also revealing the
communication-sensing trade-off.

### [6] [A Benchmark Study of Deep Learning Methods for Multi-Label Pediatric Electrocardiogram-Based Cardiovascular Disease Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03780)
*Yiqiao Chen*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文首次对深度学习在多标签儿科心血管疾病分类方面进行了基准研究，使用ZZU-pECG数据集（3716条记录，19种CVD类别），评估了ResNet-1D、BiLSTM、Transformer和Mamba 2四种模型在9导联和12导联配置下的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 心血管疾病是儿科主要健康负担，早期筛查至关重要。心电图作为无创且易获取的工具非常适合此目的，但缺乏针对儿科多标签CVD分类的深度学习基准研究。

Method: 系统评估了四种代表性深度学习范式：ResNet-1D、BiLSTM、Transformer和Mamba 2，在9导联和12导联两种配置下进行多标签儿科CVD分类。

Result: 所有模型都取得了良好结果，汉明损失低至0.0069，大多数设置下F1分数超过85%。ResNet-1D在12导联子集上达到94.67%的宏F1分数，BiLSTM和Transformer也表现出竞争力。

Conclusion: 该基准研究建立了可复用的基线，突出了不同范式的互补优势，并指出需要更大规模、多中心验证、年龄分层分析和更广泛的疾病覆盖来支持现实世界的儿科ECG应用。

Abstract: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a major pediatric health burden, and early
screening is of critical importance. Electrocardiography (ECG), as a
noninvasive and accessible tool, is well suited for this purpose. This paper
presents the first benchmark study of deep learning for multi-label pediatric
CVD classification on the recently released ZZU-pECG dataset, comprising 3716
recordings with 19 CVD categories. We systematically evaluate four
representative paradigms--ResNet-1D, BiLSTM, Transformer, and Mamba 2--under
both 9-lead and 12-lead configurations. All models achieved strong results,
with Hamming Loss as low as 0.0069 and F1-scores above 85% in most settings.
ResNet-1D reached a macro-F1 of 94.67% on the 12-lead subset, while BiLSTM and
Transformer also showed competitive performance. Per-class analysis indicated
challenges for rare conditions such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in the
9-lead subset, reflecting the effect of limited positive samples. This
benchmark establishes reusable baselines and highlights complementary strengths
across paradigms. It further points to the need for larger-scale, multi-center
validation, age-stratified analysis, and broader disease coverage to support
real-world pediatric ECG applications.

### [7] [Toward Multiband Sensing in FR3: Frequency Anisotropy Characterization and Non-Contiguous Bands Aggregation Algorithms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03787)
*Jacopo Pegoraro,Gianmaria Ventura,Dario Tagliaferri,Marco Mezzavilla,Andrea Bedin,Michele Rossi,Joerg Widmer*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该论文研究了6G网络中7-24 GHz频段（FR3）的多频段集成感知与通信（ISAC），提出了解决频率各向异性和非连续频谱挑战的新方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FR3频段为6G网络提供了前所未有的带宽和多样性，但频率各向异性和频谱非连续性对现有多频段ISAC技术构成了关键挑战。

Method: 实验表征目标频率各向异性，提出新的相位相干性度量，分析3GPP非连续FR3频段影响，并设计新算法来减轻感知伪影。

Result: 新算法在减轻感知伪影方面优于现有技术，为实现FR3多频段ISAC迈出了重要一步。

Conclusion: 该研究为FR3频段多频段ISAC的全面开发奠定了基础，解决了频率各向异性和非连续频谱带来的关键挑战。

Abstract: Frequency Range 3 (FR3) in the 7-24 GHz band will be the new spectrum for 6G
wireless networks. The bandwidth availability and diversity of FR3 offer
unprecedented opportunities for coherent multiband Integrated Sensing and
Communications (ISAC), which aggregates the carrier phase information from
multiple frequency bands to increase the sensing resolution to the cm-level.
However, the frequency anisotropy of sensing targets over GHz-wide bands and
the non-contiguity of the 6G spectrum, pose critical challenges to the
application of existing multiband ISAC techniques. We present the first study
on coherent multiband sensing in FR3. We experimentally characterize the
frequency anisotropy of targets and propose new phase coherence metrics for
multiband processing. Then, we analyze the impact of non-contiguous FR3 bands
considered by 3GPP, and design a new algorithm to mitigate the resulting
sensing artifacts, outperforming existing techniques. Our results represent a
first step toward fully developing multiband ISAC for FR3.

Conclusion: 多级源PAC编码框架在短码长下能够提供优越的密钥生成性能，解决了现有源编码方案的性能退化问题。

Abstract: Source polar coding is a potential solution for short blocklength-based
low-latency key generation with limited sources, which is a critical aspect of
six generation (6G) Internet of things. However, existing source coding schemes
still suffer from significant degradation in key generation rate and
reconciliation reliability in short blocklength regime. To address this issue,
we introduce a multilevel source polarization-adjusted convolutional (PAC)
coding framework. Furthermore, we propose a novel code construction algorithm
that jointly leverages polarization effects and the maximum likelihood (ML)
decoding error coefficient. Simulations demonstrate that the multilevel source
PAC scheme with the proposed code construction achieves superior key generation
rate under key disagreement constraints compared to conventional and multilevel
source polar coding methods even in short blocklength regimes.

Abstract: Magnetic induction (MI) communication is an effective underground emergency
communication technique after disasters such as landslides, mine collapses, and
earthquakes, due to its advantages in mediums such as soil, concrete, and
metals. However, the propagation mediums in practical MI based underground
emergency communications are usually diverse and composed randomly due to the
impact of disasters, which poses a challenge for MI communication in practical
applications. In this paper, we formulate a statistical fading channel model,
which reflects the random composition of diverse mediums and is shown to follow
a lognormal distribution. To mitigate the impact of diverse medium fading,
Multi-frequency Resonating Compensation (MuReC) based coils are used to achieve
multiband transmission. Then, we analyze the performance of MuReC based
multi-band MI communication with diverse medium fading and derive the
expressions of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) probability density functions,
ergodic capacities, average bit error rates (BERs), and outage probabilities
for both multiplexing and diversity cases. Numerical results show that MuReC
based multiband transmission schemes can effectively reduce the impact of
diverse medium fading and enhance the performance.

Abstract: The sum of random variables (RVs) appears extensively in wireless
communications, at large, both conventional and advanced, and has been subject
of longstanding research. The statistical characterization of the referred sum
is crucial to determine the performance of such communications systems.
Although efforts have been undertaken to unveil these sum statistics, e.g.,
probability density function (PDF) and cumulative distribution function (CDF),
no general efficient nor manageable solutions capable of evaluating the exact
sum PDF and CDF are available to date. The only formulations are given in terms
of either the multi-fold Brennan's integral or the multivariate Fox H-function.
Unfortunately, these methods are only feasible up to a certain number of RVs,
meaning that when the number of RVs in the sum increases, the computation of
the sum PDF and CDF is subject to stability problems, convergence issues, or
inaccurate results. In this paper, we derive new, simple, exact formulations
for the PDF and CDF of the sum of L independent and identically distributed
{\alpha}-{\mu} RVs. Unlike the available solutions, the computational
complexity of our analytical expressions is independent of the number of
summands. Capitalizing on our unprecedented findings, we analyze, in exact and
asymptotic manners, the performance of L-branch pre-detection equal-gain
combining and maximal-ratio combining receivers over {\alpha}-{\mu} fading
environments. The coding and diversity gains of the system for both receivers
are analyzed and quantified. Moreover, numerical simulations show that the
computation time reduces drastically when using our expressions, which are
arguably the most efficient and manageable formulations derived so far.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 磁感应通信在地下应急通信中具有优势，但灾后复杂环境会导致信道估计误差，影响波束成形性能，需要设计鲁棒方案来应对这种不确定性。

Result: 数值结果表明，所提出的鲁棒波束成形方案在存在信道估计误差时能有效提高通信可靠性和有效吞吐量。

Conclusion: 该鲁棒波束成形方案能够有效应对地下应急通信中的信道不确定性，提高系统性能。

Abstract: Magnetic induction (MI) communication is an effective underground emergency
communication technique after disasters such as landslides, mine collapses, and
earthquakes, due to its advantages in mediums such as soil, concrete, and
metals. Based on channel state information (CSI), magnetic beamforming can
significantly improve the performance of MI communication. However, in
post-disaster underground communication, channel estimation may suffer from
errors due to factors such as complex environmental interferences. Taking
channel estimation error into account, we formulate a beamforming optimization
problem for multi-user MI underground emergency communications, which aims to
minimize the power consumption under the constraints of sum rate and signal to
interference plus noise ratio (SINR) of each user. Based on the worst-case
optimization criterion and the S-procedure, the non-convex optimization problem
is transformed into convex and solved. Numerical results show that the proposed
robust beamforming scheme can effectively enhance communication reliability and
effective throughput in the presence of channel estimation errors.

*Vincent Savaux,Steve Sawadogo,Hyeon Seok Rou,Giuseppe Thadeu Freitas de Abreu*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文研究了AFDM和OTFS调制方案在非白高斯噪声下的鲁棒性，发现AFDM由于解调矩阵稀疏度较低而性能最优，在多数场景下比OTFS和OFDM有超过1dB的增益。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究AFDM和OTFS调制方案在非白高斯噪声环境下的性能表现，非白高斯噪声可以模拟接收信号中的各种加性干扰源。

Method: 通过分析解调矩阵的白化噪声能力及其稀疏性来评估不同调制方案的性能，AFDM的解调矩阵通常比其他波形更不稀疏。

Result: 仿真结果表明，在非白噪声存在的情况下，AFDM比OTFS和OFDM性能更好，在大多数应用场景中增益超过1dB。

Conclusion: AFDM在非白高斯噪声环境下表现出优于OTFS和OFDM的鲁棒性，其解调矩阵的低稀疏度是实现这一优势的关键因素。

Abstract: This paper investigates the robustness of affine frequency division
multiplexing (AFDM) and orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation
schemes against non-white Gaussian noise, which can model various sources of
additive disturbances to the received signal. The proposed approach
demonstrates that the performance of these waveforms depends on the ability of
the demodulation matrix to whiten the noise-a property that is, in turn,
related to the sparsity of the matrix. AFDM is shown to outperform OTFS and
orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), as its demodulation matrix
is generally less sparse than those of the other waveforms. Based on this
analysis, several application examples and use cases are presented, such as the
use of AFDM and OTFS in narrowband signals or in coexistence with OFDM signals.
Finally, simulation results confirm that AFDM achieves better performance than
OTFS and OFDM in the presence of non-white noise, with gains exceeding 1 dB in
most application scenarios.

Conclusion: 该方法成功扩展了移动目标运动学估计框架，通过引入距离变化率的导数实现了对加速度的有效估计，提高了整体估计精度。

Abstract: This letter presents a novel method for estimating the position, velocity,
and acceleration of a moving target using range-based measurements. Although
most existing studies focus on position and velocity estimation, the framework
of this letter is extended to include acceleration. To achieve this, we propose
using the derivative of the range rate, in addition to the range and range rate
measurements. The proposed method estimates the position at first using
Time-of-Arrival (TOA)-based techniques; then, develops a reformulated least
squares (LS) and weighted least squares (WLS) approaches for velocity
estimation; and finally, employs the derivative of the range rate to estimate
the acceleration using previous position and velocity estimates. On the other
hand, closed-form LS and WLS solutions are derived for both velocity and
acceleration. The simulation results show that the proposed approach provides
improved performance in estimating moving target kinematics compared to
existing methods.

Main category: eess.SP

Abstract: This paper presents CLEAR -- a closed-form localization estimator with a
reduced sensor network. The proposed method is a computationally efficient,
two-stage estimator that fuses time-difference-of-arrival (TDOA) and
frequency-difference-of-arrival (FDOA) measurements with a minimal number of
sensors. CLEAR localizes a moving source in N-dimensional space using only N+1
sensors, achieving the theoretical minimum sensor count. The first stage
introduces auxiliary range and range-rate parameters to construct a set of
pseudo-linear equations, solved via weighted least squares. An algebraic
elimination using Sylvester's resultant then reduces the problem to a quartic
equation, yielding closed-form estimates for the nuisance variables. A second,
lightweight linear refinement stage is applied to mitigate residual bias. Under
mild Gaussian noise assumptions, the estimator's position and velocity
estimates are statistically efficient, closely approaching the Cramer-Rao lower
bound (CRLB). Extensive Monte Carlo simulations in 2-D and 3-D scenarios
demonstrate CRLB-level accuracy and consistent performance gains over
representative two-stage and iterative baselines, confirming the method's high
suitability for power-constrained, distributed Internet of Things (IoT)
applications such as UAV tracking and smart transportation.

TL;DR: 提出了一种在分布式MIMO通信网络中集成多基地相干成像功能的D-ISAC系统，通过叠加特定设计的成像信号和通信信号，并优化接收AP选择策略，实现成像与通信的联合优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在相位相干分布式MIMO通信网络下行链路中集成多基地相干成像功能的挑战，需要在最大化用户频谱效率的同时实现成像功能，这要求部分AP作为接收器且发射AP发射正交信号。

Method: 设计分布式集成感知与通信系统，将特定设计的AP专用成像信号叠加到传统的用户专用通信信号上；详细设计符合扩展正交条件的成像波形和空频预编码器；提出优化的接收AP选择策略以在半双工约束下最大化成像性能。

Conclusion: 所提出的D-ISAC系统成功实现了在分布式MIMO网络中联合多基地成像和通信的功能，通过可调权衡因子和优化的接收AP选择策略，在保持通信性能的同时显著提升了成像能力。

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of integrating multistatic coherent
imaging functionalities in the downlink (DL) of a phase-coherent distributed
multiple input multiple output (D-MIMO) communication network. During DL, the
D-MIMO access points (APs) jointly precode the transmitted signals to maximize
the spectral efficiency (SE) at the users (UEs) locations. However, imaging
requires that \textit{(i)} a fraction of the APs work as receivers for sensing
and \textit{(ii)} the transmitting APs emit AP-specific and orthogonal signals
to illuminate the area to be imaged and allow multistatic operation. In these
settings, our contribution is twofold. We propose a novel distributed
integrated sensing and communication (D-ISAC) system that superposes a
purposely designed AP-specific signal for imaging to the legacy UE-specific
communication one, with a tunable trade-off factor. We detail both the imaging
waveform design according to the \textit{extended orthogonality condition} and
the space-frequency precoder design. Then, we propose an optimized selection
strategy for the receiving APs, in order to maximize imaging performance under
half-duplex constraints. Extensive numerical results prove the feasibility and
benefits of our proposal, materializing the potential of joint multistatic
imaging and communications in practical D-MIMO deployments.

TL;DR: 提出了一种物理基础的Rician衰落信道模型，用于6G室内太赫兹通信，通过联合确定性和随机分量、频率相关衰减以及两射线反射框架，显著提升了信道建模精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有信道模型在太赫兹通信中难以应对严重的频率选择性和多径效应，需要更准确的建模方法来支持6G室内网络应用。

Method: 采用物理基础的Rician衰落模型，结合确定性LOS和随机NLOS分量，使用优化的alpha和beta参数表征频率相关衰减，集成两射线反射框架捕获驻波现象，并通过宽带频谱平均减轻频率选择性。

Result: 在208 GHz载波频率下，0.1-0.9米范围内的实验测量显示，模型RMSE低至2.54 dB，比自由空间路径损耗模型提升14.2%，带宽增加时RMSE降低73.3%。

Conclusion: 该方法为太赫兹系统设计提供了坚实基础，支持可靠的室内无线个域网、设备间通信和精确定位等6G应用，并强调了带宽在抑制振荡伪影和提高建模精度中的重要性。

Abstract: Accurate channel modeling is essential for realizing the potential of
terahertz (THz) communications in 6G indoor networks, where existing models
struggle with severe frequency selectivity and multipath effects. We propose a
physically grounded Rician fading channel model that jointly incorporates
deterministic line-of-sight (LOS) and stochastic non-line-of-sight (NLOS)
components, enhanced by frequency-dependent attenuation characterized by
optimized exponents alpha and beta. Unlike conventional approaches, our model
integrates a two-ray reflection framework to capture standing wave phenomena
and employs wideband spectral averaging to mitigate frequency selectivity over
bandwidths up to 15 GHz. Empirical measurements at a 208 GHz carrier, spanning
0.1-0.9 m, demonstrate that our model achieves root mean square errors (RMSE)
as low as 2.54 dB, outperforming free-space path loss (FSPL) by up to 14.2% and
reducing RMSE by 73.3% as bandwidth increases. These findings underscore the
importance of bandwidth in suppressing oscillatory artifacts and improving
modeling accuracy. Our approach provides a robust foundation for THz system
design, supporting reliable indoor wireless personal area networks (WPANs),
device-to-device (D2D) communications, and precise localization in future 6G
applications.

Motivation: 6G网络中多模态ML模型在域偏移下泛化能力差，因为训练和测试数据分布不同，且实际无线系统中域偏移频繁发生。

Method: 第一阶段使用基于物理的损失函数学习无线环境物理特性；第二阶段提出协作域适应，通过域相似性感知模型聚合利用多个基站的无线环境知识。

Result: 基于物理的训练仅需13%的数据样本即可达到不使用物理训练的基线性能；协作域适应仅需25%的数据样本和20%的FLOPs即可收敛。

Conclusion: 该框架在稀缺多模态数据下显著提高了无线网络ML模型的泛化性能，为6G网络中的情境感知决策提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: In 6G wireless networks, multi-modal ML models can be leveraged to enable
situation-aware network decisions in dynamic environments. However, trained ML
models often fail to generalize under domain shifts when training and test data
distributions are different because they often focus on modality-specific
spurious features. In practical wireless systems, domain shifts occur
frequently due to dynamic channel statistics, moving obstacles, or hardware
configuration. Thus, there is a need for learning frameworks that can achieve
robust generalization under scarce multi-modal data in wireless networks. In
this paper, a novel and data-efficient two-phase learning framework is proposed
to improve generalization performance in unseen and unfamiliar wireless
environments with minimal amount of multi-modal data. In the first stage, a
physics-based loss function is employed to enable each BS to learn the physics
underlying its wireless environment captured by multi-modal data. The
data-efficiency of the physics-based loss function is analytically
investigated. In the second stage, collaborative domain adaptation is proposed
to leverage the wireless environment knowledge of multiple BSs to guide
under-performing BSs under domain shift. Specifically, domain-similarity-aware
model aggregation is proposed to utilize the knowledge of BSs that experienced
similar domains. To validate the proposed framework, a new dataset generation
framework is developed by integrating CARLA and MATLAB-based mmWave channel
modeling to predict mmWave RSS. Simulation results show that the proposed
physics-based training requires only 13% of data samples to achieve the same
performance as a state-of-the-art baseline that does not use physics-based
training. Moreover, the proposed collaborative domain adaptation needs only 25%
of data samples and 20% of FLOPs to achieve the convergence compared to
baselines.

Motivation: 忆阻器交叉阵列虽然能实现低功耗的向量矩阵乘法，但难以精确写入忆阻器电导值，导致计算精度受限。

Method: 首先对目标矩阵进行奇异值分解获得低秩近似，然后分解为两个较小矩阵，通过两步串行向量矩阵乘法和逐步平均来缓解随机写入误差。

Result: 推导了计算误差的一般表达式，并在规定奇异值分布下进行渐近分析，揭示了误差随矩阵大小和秩的缩放规律，理论和数值结果均证实了所提方案的优越性。

Conclusion: 基于低秩矩阵分解的方案能有效提高忆阻器交叉阵列的计算精度，为低功耗计算应用提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Memristor crossbars enable vector-matrix multiplication (VMM), and are
promising for low-power applications. However, it can be difficult to write the
memristor conductance values exactly. To improve the accuracy of VMM, we
propose a scheme based on low-rank matrix approximation. Specifically, singular
value decomposition (SVD) is first applied to obtain a low-rank approximation
of the target matrix, which is then factored into a pair of smaller matrices.
Subsequently, a two-step serial VMM is executed, where the stochastic write
errors are mitigated through step-wise averaging. To evaluate the performance
of the proposed scheme, we derive a general expression for the resulting
computation error and provide an asymptotic analysis under a prescribed
singular-value profile, which reveals how the error scales with matrix size and
rank. Both analytical and numerical results confirm the superiority of the
proposed scheme compared with the benchmark scheme.

Abstract: In recent decades Human Body Communication has emerged as a promising
alternative to traditional radio wave communication, utilizing the body's
conductive properties for low-power connectivity among wearables. This method
harnesses the human body as an energy-efficient channel for data transmission
within the electro-quasistatic frequency range, enabling advancements in
human-machine interaction. While prior work has noted the role of parasitic
return paths in such capacitively coupled systems, the influence of surrounding
metallic objects on these paths, which are critical for EQS wireless signaling,
has not been fully explored. This paper fills that gap with a structured study
of how various conducting objects, from non-grounded (floating) metals and
grounded metals to enclosed metallic environments such as elevators and cars,
affect the body-communication channel. We present a theoretical framework
supported by finite element method simulations and experiments with wearable
devices. Results show that metallic objects within 20 cm of devices can reduce
transmission loss by about 10 dB. When a device ground connects to a grounded
metallic object, channel gain can increase by at least 20 dB. Contact area
during touch-based interactions with grounded metals produces contact-impedance
dependent high-pass channel characteristics. Proximity to metallic objects
introduces variability within a critical distance, with grounded metals
producing a larger overall effect than floating metals. These findings improve
understanding of body-centric communication links and inform design for
healthcare, consumer electronics, defense, and industrial applications.

Abstract: Caching is crucial in hybrid satellite-terrestrial networks to reduce
latency, optimize throughput, and improve data availability by storing
frequently accessed content closer to users, especially in bandwidth-limited
satellite systems, requiring strategic Medium Access Control (MAC) layer. This
paper addresses throughput optimization in satellite-terrestrial integrated
networks through opportunistic cooperative caching. We propose a joint probing
and scheduling strategy to enhance content retrieval efficiency. The strategy
leverages the LEO satellite to probe satellite-to-ground links and cache states
of multiple cooperative terrestrial stations, enabling dynamic user scheduling
for content delivery. Using an optimal stopping theoretic approach with two
levels of incomplete information, we make real-time decisions on
satellite-terrestrial hybrid links and caching probing. Our threshold-based
strategy optimizes probing and scheduling, significantly improving average
system throughput by exploiting cooperative caching, satellite-terrestrial link
transmission, and time diversity from dynamic user requests. Simulation results
validate the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed strategies.

Abstract: Holographic MIMO (HMIMO) has emerged as a promising solution for future
wireless systems by enabling ultra-dense, spatially continuous antenna
deployments. While prior studies have primarily focused on electromagnetic (EM)
modeling or simulation-based performance analysis, a rigorous
communication-theoretic framework remains largely unexplored. This paper
presents the first analytical performance study of a multi-user HMIMO downlink
system with matched filter (MF) precoding - a low-complexity baseline scheme.
By incorporating multipath propagation, mutual coupling, and element
excitation, we derive a novel closed-form expression for the MF
signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) using an equivalent random
variable model. Leveraging bivariate gamma distributions, we then develop
tractable throughput approximations under full, partial, and no channel state
information (CSI) scenarios. Additionally, we formulate a max-min beamforming
problem to benchmark optimal user fairness performance. Numerical results
validate the accuracy of the proposed framework and reveal that MF precoding
achieves competitive performance with strong robustness to low SINR and CSI
uncertainty.

Abstract: Networked integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) has gained significant
attention as a promising technology for enabling next-generation wireless
systems. To further enhance networked ISAC, delegating the reception of sensing
signals to dedicated target monitoring terminals (TMTs) instead of base
stations (BSs) offers significant advantages in terms of sensing capability and
deployment flexibility. Despite its potential, the coordinated beamforming
design for networked integrated communication and time-of-arrival (ToA)-based
multi-TMT localization remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we present a
comprehensive study to fill this gap. Specifically, we first establish signal
models for both communication and localization, and, for the first time, derive
a closed-form Cram\'er-Rao lower bound (CRLB) to characterize the localization
performance. Subsequently, we exploit this CRLB to formulate two optimization
problems, focusing on sensing-centric and communication-centric criteria,
respectively. For the sensing-centric problem, we develop a globally optimal
algorithm based on semidefinite relaxation (SDR) when each BS is equipped with
more antennas than the total number of communication users. While for the
communication-centric problem, we design a globally optimal algorithm for the
single-BS case using bisection search. For the general case of both problems,
we propose a unified successive convex approximation (SCA)-based algorithm,
which is suboptimal yet efficient, and further extend it from single-target
scenarios to more practical multi-target scenarios. Finally, simulation results
demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms, reveal the intrinsic
performance trade-offs between communication and localization, and further show
that deploying more TMTs is always preferable to deploying more BSs in
networked ISAC systems.

Abstract: Unitary matrices are the basis of a large number of signal processing
applications. In many of these applications, finding ways to efficiently store,
and even transmit these matrices, can significantly reduce memory and
throughput requirements. In this work, we study the problem of efficient
transmission and storage of unitary matrices. Specifically, we explicitly
derive a dimensionally-efficient parametrization (DEP) for unitary matrices
that allows identifying them with sequences of real numbers, where the
dimension coincides with the dimension of the unitary group where they lie. We
also characterize its inverse map that allows retrieving the original unitary
matrices from their DEP. The proposed approach effectively allows halving the
dimension with respect to naively considering all the entries of each unitary
matrix, thus reducing the resources required to store and transmit these
matrices. Furthermore, we show that the sequence of real numbers associated to
the proposed DEP is bounded, and we delimit the interval where these numbers
are contained, facilitating the implementation of quantization approaches with
limited distortion. On the other hand, we outline ways to further reduce the
dimension of the DEP when considering more restrictive constraints for matrices
that show up in certain applications. The numerical results showcase the
potential of the proposed approach in general settings, as well as in three
specific applications of current interest for wireless communications research.

Abstract: In this work, we study a multi-user NTN in which a satellite serves as the
primary network and a high-altitude platform station (HAPS) operates as the
secondary network, acting as a cognitive radio. To reduce the cost, complexity,
and power consumption of conventional antenna arrays, we equip the HAPS with a
transmissive BD-RIS antenna front end. We then formulate a joint optimization
problem for the BD-RIS phase response and the HAPS transmit power allocation
under strict per-user interference temperature constraints. To tackle the
resulting highly nonconvex problem, we propose an alternating-optimization
framework: the power-allocation subproblem admits a closed-form,
water-filling-type solution derived from the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT)
conditions, while the BD-RIS configuration is refined via Riemannian manifold
optimization. Simulation results show significant gains in data rate and
interference suppression over diagonal RIS-assisted benchmarks, establishing
BD-RIS as a promising enabler for future multilayer NTNs.

Abstract: One of the main challenges facing Internet of Things (IoT) networks is
managing interference caused by the large number of devices communicating
simultaneously, particularly in multi-cluster networks where multiple devices
simultaneously transmit to their respective receiver. Over-the-Air Computation

scheme tailored for up-link AirComp systems. Unlike previous approaches, the
proposed method scales to an arbitrary number $\sf K$ of clusters and enables
each cluster to exploit half of the available channels, instead of only
$\tfrac{1}{\sf K}$ as in time-sharing. In addition, we develop schemes tailored
to scenarios where users are shared between adjacent clusters.

Abstract: In every imaging or sensing application, the physical hardware creates
constraints that must be overcome or they limit system performance. Techniques
that leverage additional degrees of freedom can effectively extend performance
beyond the inherent physical capabilities of the hardware. An example includes
synchronizing distributed sensors so as to synthesize a larger aperture for
remote sensing applications. An additional example is integrating the
communication and sensing functions in a wireless system through the clever
design of waveforms and optimized resource management. As these technologies
mature beyond the conceptual and prototype phase they will ultimately
transition to the commercial market. Here, standards play a critical role in
ensuring success. Standards ensure interoperability between systems
manufactured by different vendors and define industry best practices for
vendors and customers alike. The Signal Processing Society of the Institute for
Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) plays a leading role in developing
high-quality standards for computational sensing technologies through the
working groups of the Synthetic Aperture Standards Committee (SASC). In this
column we highlight the standards activities of the P3383 Performance Metrics
for Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) Systems Working Group and the
P3343 Spatio-Temporal Synchronization of a Synthetic Aperture of Distributed
Sensors Working Group.

### [29] [Steady-State Spread Bounds for Graph Diffusion via Laplacian Regularisation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04924)
*Ardavan Rahimian*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文研究了图上的扩散过程在拉普拉斯正则化设计的初始模式下能偏离多远，给出了稳态扩散相对于初始分布的闭式上界，并提出了简单的正则化强度设计规则。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究在拉普拉斯正则化产生的初始模式下，图扩散过程能达到的最大稳态偏离，为系统设计提供理论保证。

Method: 基于无向非负图的稳定性条件，推导出稳态扩散相对于初始分布的闭式上界，该界限分离了图最大节点度决定的不可约项和设计控制项。

Result: 得到了实例特定的上界，显示设计控制项随正则化强度增加而减小（遵循逆平方根定律），并提出了给定扩散限制时选择正则化强度的闭式设计规则。

Conclusion: 该保证是非渐近的、易于计算的，能够证明稳态偏差可能发生的程度，适用于任何先执行拉普拉斯平滑然后进行图线性扩散的场景。

Abstract: We study how far a diffusion process on a graph can drift from a designed
starting pattern when that pattern is produced using Laplacian regularisation.
Under standard stability conditions for undirected, entrywise nonnegative
graphs, we give a closed-form, instance-specific upper bound on the
steady-state spread, measured as the relative change between the final and
initial profiles. The bound separates two effects: (i) an irreducible term
determined by the graph's maximum node degree, and (ii) a design-controlled
term that shrinks as the regularisation strength increases (following an
inverse square-root law). This leads to a simple design rule: given any target
limit on spread, one can choose a sufficient regularisation strength in closed
form. Although one motivating application is array beamforming, where the
initial pattern is the squared magnitude of the beamformer weights, the result
applies to any scenario that first enforces Laplacian smoothness and then
evolves by linear diffusion on a graph. Overall, the guarantee is
non-asymptotic, easy to compute, and certifies how much steady-state deviation
can occur.

Abstract: To support the development of low altitude economy, the air-ground integrated
sensing and communication (ISAC) networks need to be constructed to provide
reliable and robust communication and sensing services. In this paper, the
sensing capabilities in the cooperative air-ground ISAC networks are evaluated
in terms of area radar detection coverage probability under a constant false
alarm rate, where the distribution of aggregated sensing interferences is
analyzed as a key intermediate result. Compared with the analysis based on the
strongest interferer approximation, taking the aggregated sensing interference
into consideration is better suited for pico-cell scenarios with high base
station density. Simulations are conducted to validate the analysis.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种在联邦学习空中聚合中自适应设计接收缩放因子的方法，以平衡训练收敛性和隐私保护之间的权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在联邦学习的空中聚合中，接收缩放因子对信号质量至关重要。较大的缩放因子能降低有效噪声功率并改善训练性能，但会通过减少不确定性来损害设备隐私。

Method: 开发了名为AdaScale的新在线算法，基于一系列新颖的每轮问题，能够高效解决。该算法在动态信道条件下自适应设计接收缩放因子。

Result: 数值实验表明，与最先进的基准方法相比，该方法在不影响学习性能的情况下有效减少了RDP和DP泄漏。

Conclusion: AdaScale算法能够在确保联邦学习训练收敛到平稳点的同时，实现时间平均RDP泄漏的递减动态遗憾，有效平衡了隐私保护和训练性能。

Abstract: In Federated Learning (FL) with over-the-air aggregation, the quality of the
signal received at the server critically depends on the receive scaling
factors. While a larger scaling factor can reduce the effective noise power and
improve training performance, it also compromises the privacy of devices by
reducing uncertainty. In this work, we aim to adaptively design the receive
scaling factors across training rounds to balance the trade-off between
training convergence and privacy in an FL system under dynamic channel
conditions. We formulate a stochastic optimization problem that minimizes the
overall R\'enyi differential privacy (RDP) leakage over the entire training
process, subject to a long-term constraint that ensures convergence of the
global loss function. Our problem depends on unknown future information, and we
observe that standard Lyapunov optimization is not applicable. Thus, we develop
a new online algorithm, termed AdaScale, based on a sequence of novel per-round
problems that can be solved efficiently. We further derive upper bounds on the
dynamic regret and constraint violation of AdaSacle, establishing that it
achieves diminishing dynamic regret in terms of time-averaged RDP leakage while
ensuring convergence of FL training to a stationary point. Numerical
experiments on canonical classification tasks show that our approach
effectively reduces RDP and DP leakages compared with state-of-the-art
benchmarks without compromising learning performance.

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: PoM²-DIB是一个新颖的语义通信框架，通过扩展分布式信息瓶颈理论，引入模态选择机制来优化多模态多任务语义通信，在物理限制下实现高效通信和高质量推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于AI的多模态多任务语义通信方案通常要求发射器拥有完整模态数据并参与所有接收器任务，这导致冗余传输，与信道容量和计算能力的物理限制相冲突。

Method: 扩展分布式信息瓶颈理论，引入模态选择作为关键设计变量；将模态选择放松为概率形式，使用分数函数估计和共同随机性实现分布式设备的可优化协调决策；遵循高效的DIB编码。

Result: 在公共数据集上的实验结果表明，PoM²-DIB在各种任务的物理限制下，相比全参与基线方法实现了高质量的推理性能。

Conclusion: PoM²-DIB框架通过模态选择和分布式信息瓶颈的有效结合，在遵守物理约束的同时，实现了通信效率和推理质量之间的灵活权衡。

Abstract: Semantic communication (SemCom) shifts the focus from data transmission to
meaning delivery, enabling efficient and intelligent communication.
  Existing AI-based coding schemes for multi-modal multi-task SemCom often
require transmitters with full-modal data to participate in all receivers'
tasks, which leads to redundant transmissions and conflicts with the physical
limits of channel capacity and computational capability.
  In this paper, we propose PoM$^2$-DIB, a novel framework that extends the
distributed information bottleneck (DIB) theory to address this problem.
  Unlike the typical DIB, this framework introduces modality selection as an
additional key design variable, enabling a more flexible tradeoff between
communication rate and inference quality.
  This extension selects only the most relevant modalities for task
participation, adhering to the physical constraints, while following efficient
DIB-based coding.
  To optimize selection and coding end-to-end, we relax modality selection into
a probabilistic form, allowing the use of score function estimation with common
randomness to enable optimizable coordinated decisions across distributed
devices.
  Experimental results on public datasets verify that PoM$^2$-DIB achieves high
inference quality compared to full-participation baselines in various tasks
under physical limits.

*Neri Merhav,Shlomo Shamai*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 该论文提出了两种下界方法来估计高斯信道在点式加性输入约束下的容量，分别基于熵功率不等式和互信息直接操作，适用于连续和离散输入字母表。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究高斯信道在点式加性输入约束（而非期望约束）下的容量下界，这类约束在实际应用中更常见且更具挑战性。

Method: 使用类型方法扩展到连续字母表、鞍点积分方法和大偏差理论工具，精确评估满足约束的输入向量集合的体积指数，提出基于EPI和直接互信息操作的两类下界。

Result: 得到了相对简单且统一的下界，第二类方法虽然技术更复杂但能产生更强更紧的下界，并通过数值示例验证了两种下界的有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的下界方法为高斯信道在点式加性约束下的容量分析提供了有效工具，第二类方法在性能上更优但计算复杂度更高。

Abstract: We present a family of relatively simple and unified lower bounds on the
capacity of the Gaussian channel under a set of pointwise additive input
constraints. Specifically, the admissible channel input vectors $\bx = (x_1,
\ldots, x_n)$ must satisfy $k$ additive cost constraints of the form
$\sum_{i=1}^n \phi_j(x_i) \le n \Gamma_j$, $j = 1,2,\ldots,k$, which are
enforced pointwise for every $\bx$, rather than merely in expectation. More
generally, we also consider cost functions that depend on a sliding window of
fixed length $m$, namely, $\sum_{i=m}^n \phi_j(x_i, x_{i-1}, \ldots, x_{i-m+1})
\le n \Gamma_j$, $j = 1,2,\ldots,k$, a formulation that naturally accommodates
correlation constraints as well as a broad range of other constraints of
practical relevance. We propose two classes of lower bounds, derived by two
methodologies that both rely on the exact evaluation of the volume exponent
associated with the set of input vectors satisfying the given constraints. This
evaluation exploits extensions of the method of types to continuous alphabets,
the saddle-point method of integration, and basic tools from large deviations
theory. The first class of bounds is obtained via the entropy power inequality
(EPI), and therefore applies exclusively to continuous-valued inputs. The
second class, by contrast, is more general, and it applies to discrete input
alphabets as well. It is based on a direct manipulation of mutual information,
and it yields stronger and tighter bounds, though at the cost of greater
technical complexity. Numerical examples illustrating both types of bounds are
provided, and several extensions and refinements are also discussed.

Conclusion: 建立了相位恢复与等周问题之间的深刻联系，为理解最优框架的几何特性提供了新视角，并修正了之前关于谐波框架最优性的错误认识。

Abstract: This paper aims to characterize the optimal frame for phase retrieval,
defined as the frame whose condition number for phase retrieval attains its
minimal value. In the context of the two-dimensional real case, we reveal the
connection between optimal frames for phase retrieval and the
perimeter-maximizing isodiametric problem, originally proposed by Reinhardt in
1922. Our work establishes that every optimal solution to the
perimeter-maximizing isodiametric problem inherently leads to an optimal frame
in ${\mathbb R}^2$. By recasting the optimal polygons problem as one concerning
the discrepancy of roots of unity, we characterize all optimal polygons.
Building upon this connection, we then characterize all optimal frames with $m$
vectors in ${\mathbb R}^2$ for phase retrieval when $m \geq 3$ has an odd
factor. As a key corollary, we show that the harmonic frame $E_m$ is {\em not}
optimal for any even integer $m \geq 4$. This finding disproves a conjecture
proposed by Xia, Xu, and Xu (Math. Comp., 90(356): 2931-2960). Previous work
has established that the harmonic frame $E_m \subset {\mathbb R}^2$ is indeed
optimal when $m$ is an odd integer.
  Exploring the connection between phase retrieval and discrete geometry, this
paper aims to illuminate advancements in phase retrieval and offer new
perspectives on the perimeter-maximizing isodiametric problem.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 连接整数乘法动态的宏观统计特性与通用编码长度，探索机器适应机制与人类生成复杂性之间的定性差异。

Method: 引入乘法图灵集合(MTE)，使用变分建模方法，以Elias Omega编码长度为能量函数，施加最大熵约束得到整数和质数的吉布斯先验分布。

Result: 理论证明对数乘子具有指数尾部，产生加性间隙的帕累托尾部；在Debian和PyPI包大小数据集上，缩放Omega先验在编码长度直方图上获得最低KL散度。

Conclusion: 机器适应机制（吉布斯对齐，有限一阶矩）表现出清晰的平均行为，而人类生成的复杂性则超出此机制，尾部足够重导致无界一阶矩，无法实现同类平均。

Abstract: We study integer-valued multiplicative dynamics driven by i.i.d. prime
multipliers and connect their macroscopic statistics to universal codelengths.
We introduce the Multiplicative Turing Ensemble (MTE) and show how it arises
naturally - though not uniquely - from ensembles of probabilistic Turing
machines. Our modeling principle is variational: taking Elias' Omega codelength
as an energy and imposing maximum entropy constraints yields a canonical Gibbs
prior on integers and, by restriction, on primes. Under mild tail assumptions,
this prior induces exponential tails for log-multipliers (up to slowly varying
corrections), which in turn generate Pareto tails for additive gaps. We also
prove time-average laws for the Omega codelength along MTE trajectories.
Empirically, on Debian and PyPI package size datasets, a scaled Omega prior
achieves the lowest KL divergence against codelength histograms. Taken
together, the theory-data comparison suggests a qualitative split:
machine-adapted regimes (Gibbs-aligned, finite first moment) exhibit clean
averaging behavior, whereas human-generated complexity appears to sit beyond
this regime, with tails heavy enough to produce an unbounded first moment, and
therefore no averaging of the same kind.

Motivation: 传统阈值算法在搜索方向和阈值策略方面存在改进空间，特别是牛顿方法计算成本高的问题需要解决。

Conclusion: 提出的压缩牛顿方向阈值算法在保持效率的同时显著降低了计算成本，是解决稀疏优化问题的有效方法。

Abstract: Thresholding algorithms for sparse optimization problems involve two key
components: search directions and thresholding strategies. In this paper, we
use the compressed Newton direction as a search direction, derived by confining
the classical Newton step to a low-dimensional subspace and embedding it back
into the full space with diagonal regularization. This approach significantly
reduces the computational cost for finding the search direction while
maintaining the efficiency of Newton-like methods. Based on this new search
direction, we propose two major classes of algorithms by adopting hard or
optimal thresholding: the compressed Newton-direction-based thresholding
pursuit (CNHTP) and compressed Newton-direction-based optimal thresholding
pursuit (CNOTP). We establish the global convergence of the proposed algorithms
under the restricted isometry property. Experimental results demonstrate that
the proposed algorithms perform comparably to several state-of-the-art methods
in terms of success frequency and solution accuracy for solving the sparse
optimization problem.

Abstract: Next-generation multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, characterized
by extremely large-scale arrays, holographic surfaces, three-dimensional
architectures, and flexible antennas, are poised to deliver unprecedented data
rates, spectral efficiency and stability. However, these advancements introduce
significant challenges for physical layer signal processing, stemming from
complex near-field propagation, continuous aperture modeling, sub-wavelength
antenna coupling effects, and dynamic channel conditions. Conventional
model-based and deep learning approaches often struggle with the immense
computational complexity and model inaccuracies inherent in these new regimes.
This article proposes a Fourier neural operator (FNO) as a powerful and
promising tool to address these challenges. The FNO learns function-to-function
mappings between infinite-dimensional function spaces, making them
exceptionally well-suited for modeling complex physical systems governed by
partial differential equations based on electromagnetic wave propagation. We
first present the fundamental principles of FNO, demonstrating its mesh-free
nature and function-to-function ability to efficiently capture global
dependencies in the Fourier domain. Furthermore, we explore a range of
applications of FNO in physical-layer signal processing for next-generation
MIMO systems. Representative case studies on channel modeling and estimation
for novel MIMO architectures demonstrate the superior performance of FNO
compared to state-of-the-art methods. Finally, we discuss open challenges and
outline future research directions, positioning FNO as a promising technology
for enabling the enormous potential of next-generation MIMO systems.

Abstract: We consider the problem of decentralized constrained optimization with
multiple agents $E_1,\ldots,E_N$ who jointly wish to learn the optimal solution
set while keeping their feasible sets $\mathcal{P}_1,\ldots,\mathcal{P}_N$
private from each other. We assume that the objective function $f$ is known to
all agents and each feasible set is a collection of points from a universal
alphabet $\mathcal{P}_{alph}$. A designated agent (leader) starts the
communication with the remaining (non-leader) agents, and is the first to
retrieve the solution set. The leader searches for the solution by sending
queries to and receiving answers from the non-leaders, such that the
information on the individual feasible sets revealed to the leader should be no
more than nominal, i.e., what is revealed from learning the solution set alone.
We develop achievable schemes for obtaining the solution set at nominal
information leakage, and characterize their communication costs under two
communication setups between agents. In this work, we focus on two kinds of
network setups: i) ring, where each agent communicates with two adjacent
agents, and ii) star, where only the leader communicates with the remaining
agents. We show that, if the leader first learns the joint feasible set through
an existing private set intersection (PSI) protocol and then deduces the
solution set, the information leaked to the leader is greater than nominal.
Moreover, we draw connection of our schemes to threshold PSI (ThPSI), which is
a PSI-variant where the intersection is revealed only when its cardinality is
larger than a threshold value. Finally, for various realizations of $f$ mapped
uniformly at random to a fixed range of values, our schemes are more
communication-efficient with a high probability compared to retrieving the
entire feasible set through PSI.
