*Xuyang Sun,Hussein A. Ammar,Israfil Bahceci,Raviraj Adve,Gary Boudreau,Zehua Li*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种解决5G系统中由大气波导效应引起的远程干扰问题的方法，通过角度估计和干扰消除技术，在低发射功率条件下实现上行链路通信。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Abstract: With the rapid deployment of 5G systems, remote interference (RI) caused by
atmospheric ducting has emerged as an occasional, but critical challenge. This
phenomenon occurs when the downlink (DL) signals from distant base stations
(BSs) propagate over long distances through tropospheric ducting, severely
disrupting uplink (UL) reception at local BSs. To address this challenge, we
analyze the effect of RI on network performance, including the channel
estimation phase. We then develop a solution that identifies the
angle-of-arrival (AOA) estimation of RI and designs precoders and combiners
that mitigate RI. Our approach employs interference cancellation techniques
through null precoding and fractional programming which enhance the performance
of the network. Interestingly, we show that using our scheme, uplink
communication is possible at low transmit power regimes that were unusable due
to RI. Our results further show a 5.23~dB reduction in normalized mean square
error for channel estimation and achieved data rates around 5.8~bit/s/Hz at the
previously unusable low uplink transmit power conditions.

### [2] [Data-Driven Deployment of Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces in Cellular Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10190)
*Sina Beyraghi,Javad Shabanpour,Giovanni Geraci,Paul Almasan,Angel Lozano*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 提出了一种完全自动化的数据驱动框架，用于在蜂窝网络中大规模部署可重构智能表面(RIS)，通过联合优化RIS位置、方向、配置和基站波束成形来提升城市环境中的网络覆盖。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在密集城市环境中部署RIS时面临的复杂优化问题，包括位置选择、方向配置等，并评估覆盖增益与基础设施成本之间的权衡。

Method: 利用物理一致的射线追踪和英国商业部署的实测数据，通过反射和散射启发式算法识别候选RIS位置，使用Sionna射线追踪引擎进行电磁建模，并对中断用户进行聚类以降低部署复杂度。

Result: 研究表明，在城市区域实现有意义的覆盖改进需要部署密集的大孔径RIS单元，这引发了成本效益的质疑。

Conclusion: 虽然RIS技术有潜力改善网络覆盖，但大规模部署的成本效益需要仔细评估，同时提供了开源仿真框架以促进可重复性和未来研究。

Abstract: This paper presents a fully automated, data-driven framework for the
large-scale deployment of reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) in
cellular networks. Leveraging physically consistent ray tracing and empirical
data from a commercial deployment in the UK, the proposed method jointly
optimizes RIS placement, orientation, configuration, and base station
beamforming in dense urban environments across frequency bands (corresponding
to 4G, 5G, and a hypothetical 6G system). Candidate RIS locations are
identified via reflection- and scattering-based heuristics using calibrated
electromagnetic models within the Sionna Ray Tracing (RT) engine. Outage users
are clustered to reduce deployment complexity, and the tradeoff between
coverage gains and infrastructure cost is systematically evaluated. It is shown
that achieving meaningful coverage improvement in urban areas requires a dense
deployment of large-aperture RIS units, raising questions about
cost-effectiveness. To facilitate reproducibility and future research, the
complete simulation framework and RIS deployment algorithms are provided as
open-source software.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自2006年提出以来，差分隐私已成为量化敏感数据分析发布或共享风险的标准化方法。其核心是基于概率分布差异来衡量风险，这正是信息论的核心主题。

Method: 将差分隐私算法视为底层数据与分析输出之间的信道，从信道特性角度理解差分隐私的保证，为相关信息度量赋予'操作意义'。

Result: 建立了差分隐私与信息论之间的关键联系，展示了如何通过信息论框架来理解和解释差分隐私的隐私保护机制。

Conclusion: 信息论为差分隐私的制定和应用提供了理论基础，通过信道视角能够更深入地理解差分隐私的隐私保证机制。

Abstract: Since being proposed in 2006, differential privacy has become a standard
method for quantifying certain risks in publishing or sharing analyses of
sensitive data. At its heart, differential privacy measures risk in terms of
the differences between probability distributions, which is a central topic in
information theory. A differentially private algorithm is a channel between the
underlying data and the output of the analysis. Seen in this way, the
guarantees made by differential privacy can be understood in terms of
properties of this channel. In this article we examine a few of the key
connections between information theory and the formulation/application of
differential privacy, giving an ``operational significance'' for relevant
information measures.

### [4] [Quantum-Resistant Cryptography via Universal Gröbner Bases](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10429)
*Sergio Da Silva,Aniya Stewart*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于通用Gröbner基的后量子密码密钥建立协议，利用生成通用Gröbner基的计算复杂度差异来提供安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发能够抵抗量子攻击的公钥密码系统，利用多项式理想的通用Gröbner基作为私钥，基于计算复杂性差异提供安全性。

Method: 使用多项式理想的通用Gröbner基作为私钥，加密使用单个Gröbner基，解密需要计算整个Gröbner扇面来构造通用Gröbner基。

Result: 分析了协议的安全性参数和复杂度，并为图的环面理想提供了递归生成通用Gröbner基的高效方法。

Conclusion: 基于通用Gröbner基的密码协议具有抵抗量子攻击的潜力，其安全性依赖于直接计算Gröbner扇面的困难性。

Abstract: In this article, we explore the use of universal Gr\"obner bases in
public-key cryptography by proposing a key establishment protocol that is
resistant to quantum attacks. By utilizing a universal Gr\"obner basis
$\mathcal{U}_I$ of a polynomial ideal $I$ as a private key, this protocol
leverages the computational disparity between generating the universal
Gr\"obner basis needed for decryption compared with the single Gr\"obner basis
used for encryption. The security of the system lies in the difficulty of
directly computing the Gr\"obner fan of $I$ required to construct
$\mathcal{U}_I$. We provide an analysis of the security of the protocol and the
complexity of its various parameters. Additionally, we provide efficient ways
to recursively generate $\mathcal{U}_I$ for toric ideals of graphs with
techniques which are also of independent interest to the study of these ideals.

### [5] [On the Capacity of Distributed Quantum Storage](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10568)
*Hua Sun,Syed A. Jafar*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 本文研究了分布式量子存储的容量问题，通过存储图表示解码集，分析了多种图结构的容量特性，并建立了量子CSS码与经典安全存储问题的联系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究分布式量子存储的容量极限，解决在任意指定存储节点大小和擦除模式下的量子消息存储问题，特别是处理非均匀的节点大小和擦除模式。

Method: 使用存储图表示解码集，通过量子CSS码与经典安全存储问题建立联系，利用非平凡对齐结构确保恢复和安全性，并基于量子信息不等式（如强次可加性和弱单调性）进行反证分析。

Result: 针对多种图结构（包括MDS图、轮图、Fano图和交集图）给出了容量表征，证明了所提编码方案的可实现性。

Conclusion: 分布式量子存储的容量可以通过存储图的拓扑结构来表征，量子CSS码与经典安全存储问题的联系为构建非平凡的量子编码方案提供了理论基础。

Abstract: A distributed quantum storage code maps a quantum message to N storage nodes,
of arbitrary specified sizes, such that the stored message is robust to an
arbitrary specified set of erasure patterns. The sizes of the storage nodes,
and erasure patterns may not be homogeneous. The capacity of distributed
quantum storage is the maximum feasible size of the quantum message (relative
to the sizes of the storage nodes), when the scaling of the size of the message
and all storage nodes by the same scaling factor is allowed. Representing the
decoding sets as hyperedges in a storage graph, the capacity is characterized
for various graphs, including MDS graph, wheel graph, Fano graph, and
intersection graph. The achievability is related via quantum CSS codes to a
classical secure storage problem. Remarkably, our coding schemes utilize
non-trivial alignment structures to ensure recovery and security in the
corresponding classical secure storage problem, which leads to similarly
non-trivial quantum codes. The converse is based on quantum information
inequalities, e.g., strong sub-additivity and weak monotonicity of quantum
entropy, tailored to the topology of the storage graphs.

### [6] [Soft-Decoding Reverse Reconciliation in Discrete-Modulation CV-QKD](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10674)
*Marco Origlia,Marco Secondini*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于PAM/QAM调制的连续变量量子密钥分发中的新型反向协调技术，通过Bob向Alice披露精心设计的软度量来帮助其恢复Bob的密钥，同时不向窃听者泄露额外信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在离散调制格式中，Bob拥有软信息而Alice只有硬信息，这迫使Alice依赖硬判决解码来恢复Bob的密钥，限制了密钥提取效率。

Method: Bob向Alice披露精心设计的软度量，在编码层面使用二进制LDPC码和置信传播解码实现该方案。

Result: 所提技术的可实现密钥率接近上界，相比硬判决反向协调有显著增益，通过数值仿真评估了误码率。

Conclusion: 该方案有效提升了离散调制下连续变量量子密钥分发的密钥提取效率，但仍存在残余差距需要进一步研究。

Abstract: In continuous-variable quantum key distribution, information reconciliation
is required to extract a shared secret key from correlated random variables
obtained through the quantum channel. Reverse reconciliation (RR) is generally
preferred, since the eavesdropper has less information about Bob's measurements
than about Alice's transmitted symbols. When discrete modulation formats are
employed, however, soft information is available only at Bob's side, while
Alice has access only to hard information (her transmitted sequence). This
forces her to rely on hard-decision decoding to recover Bob's key.
  In this work, we introduce a novel RR technique for PAM (and QAM) in which
Bob discloses a carefully designed soft metric to help Alice recover Bob's key,
while leaking no additional information about the key to an eavesdropper. We
assess the performance of the proposed technique in terms of achievable secret
key rate (SKR) and its bounds, showing that the achievable SKR closely
approaches the upper bound, with a significant gain over hard-decision RR.
Finally, we implement the scheme at the coded level using binary LDPC codes
with belief-propagation decoding, assess its bit-error rate through numerical
simulations, compare the observed gain with theoretical predictions from the
achievable SKR, and discuss the residual gap.

Conclusion: 柔性扇区基站相比基准方案显著提升网络吞吐量，验证了所提解决方案的有效性

Abstract: This paper presents a cost-effective and easily-deployable flexible-sector
six-dimensional movable antenna (6DMA) architecture for future wireless
communication networks, which enables flexible antenna configurations to match
users' spatial distribution for capacity enhancement. Different from
conventional sectorized base station (BS) with fixed-position antennas (FPAs),
the flexible-sector 6DMA-enabled BS employs multiple directional sector antenna
arrays that can flexibly move along a common circular track. By properly moving
antennas across sectors and rotating all sector antenna arrays synchronously,
the flexible-sector BS can adjust the coverage regions of all sectors with
flexible antenna allocations over them. In particular, we consider the
multiuser downlink communication employing the orthogonal multiple access (OMA)
to serve users in each sector. Under this setup, we jointly optimize the sector
rotation and the antenna allocation at the flexible-sector BS to maximize the
average common throughput achievable for all users based on their spatial
distribution. We solve this non-convex optimization problem by deriving
closed-form solutions and thereby analyze the effect of users' spatial
distribution on the achievable common throughput. It is shown that equal user
distribution over sectors is optimal for maximizing the common throughput.
Motivated by this result, we further develop a low-complexity suboptimal
solution for the sector rotation that minimizes the variance of user numbers
across sectors. Finally, we provide simulation results to verify our analytical
results and validate the performance of our proposed solutions. It is
demonstrated that the flexible-sector BS significantly improves the network
throughput as compared to other benchmark schemes.

### [8] [Forward-Forward Autoencoder Architectures for Energy-Efficient Wireless Communications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11418)

Motivation: 深度学习在通信系统中的应用日益重要，但传统的反向传播算法需要可微通信信道和全局导数，限制了能效实现。前向-前向算法提供了更高效的替代方案。

Method: 采用前向-前向算法设计端到端学习自编码器，在加性高斯白噪声和瑞利块衰落信道中进行数值评估，并与反向传播训练系统进行比较。

Result: 在联合编码调制和固定非可微调制场景下，前向-前向算法训练的系统与反向传播系统具有竞争力，同时实现了显著的内存和处理时间节省。

Conclusion: 前向-前向算法是通信系统中深度学习应用的高效替代方案，特别适用于非可微信道，在保持性能的同时大幅提升能效和计算效率。

Abstract: The application of deep learning to the area of communications systems has
been a growing field of interest in recent years. Forward-forward (FF) learning
is an efficient alternative to the backpropagation (BP) algorithm, which is the
typically used training procedure for neural networks. Among its several
advantages, FF learning does not require the communication channel to be
differentiable and does not rely on the global availability of partial
derivatives, allowing for an energy-efficient implementation. In this work, we
design end-to-end learned autoencoders using the FF algorithm and numerically
evaluate their performance for the additive white Gaussian noise and Rayleigh
block fading channels. We demonstrate their competitiveness with BP-trained
systems in the case of joint coding and modulation, and in a scenario where a
fixed, non-differentiable modulation stage is applied. Moreover, we provide
further insights into the design principles of the FF network, its training
convergence behavior, and significant memory and processing time savings
compared to BP-based approaches.

### [9] [Repeated-and-Offset QPSK for DFT-s-OFDM in Satellite Access](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11445)
*Renaud-Alexandre Pitaval*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的RO-QPSK调制方案，将卫星通信中的OQPSK适配到地面系统的DFT-s-OFDM波形，具有低PAPR和改善SINR的性能优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推动地面蜂窝网络与卫星网络的融合，将传统卫星系统使用的OQPSK调制适配到地面系统上行链路使用的DFT-s-OFDM波形。

Method: 引入RO-QPSK调制方案，推导其基本特性，并与5G中的pi/2-BPSK加频域频谱整形进行比较。

Result: RO-QPSK自然产生汉宁窗形状频谱，PAPR极低（约2dB），在窄带和中等频率选择性信道中能改善SINR。

Conclusion: RO-QPSK是卫星通信中DFT-s-OFDM系统的有效调制方案，可结合适度FDSS进一步降低PAPR。

Abstract: Motivated by the convergence of terrestrial cellular networks with satellite
networks, we consider an adaptation of offset quadrature phase shift keying
(OQPSK), used with single-carrier waveform in traditional satellite systems, to
discrete Fourier transform spread (DFT-s-) orthogonal frequency-division
multiplexed (OFDM) waveform employed in the uplink of terrestrial systems. We
introduce a new order-one constellation modulation, termed repeated-and-offset
QPSK (RO-QPSK), derive its basic properties, and compare it with pi/2-BPSK with
frequency-domain spectral shaping (FDSS), as supported in 5G. RO-QPSK naturally
produces a Hann-window-shaped spectrum, resulting in a very low maximum
peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) on the order of 2 dB. Moreover, with
single-tap equalization and symbol combining at the receiver, RO-QSPK can
improve the signal-to-interference-plus-noise (SINR) compared to pi/2-BPSK with
FDSS, in narrowband and/or moderately frequency-selective channels, as
encountered in satellite communications. A moderate FDSS can also be combined
with RO-QSPK to further reduce the PAPR while providing similar performance. Of
independent interest, general SINR expressions for DFT-s-OFDM are also
provided.

### [10] [List Decoding Reed--Solomon Codes in the Lee, Euclidean, and Other Metrics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11453)
*Chris Peikert,Alexandra Veliche Hostetler*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 提出了一个多项式时间算法，用于在ℓ_p度量下列表解码广义Reed-Solomon码，支持任意0<p≤2，相比现有算法能解码更大距离并具有更好的距离-速率权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Reed-Solomon码纠错算法主要关注汉明距离，但在某些应用中，依赖于错误具体值的其他度量可能更合适。

Method: 开发多项式时间算法，在ℓ_p半度量下对广义Reed-Solomon码进行列表解码，并证明特定GRS码子类的最小距离下界。

Result: 算法能解码到任意大距离，在中等阈值以上的所有解码距离具有更好的距离-速率权衡，且在随机拉普拉斯和高斯误差下支持更大速率。

Conclusion: 该算法在ℓ_p度量下实现了高效的列表解码，为Reed-Solomon码在更广泛度量空间中的应用提供了新工具。

Abstract: Reed--Solomon error-correcting codes are ubiquitous across computer science
and information theory, with applications in cryptography, computational
complexity, communication and storage systems, and more. Most works on
efficient error correction for these codes, like the celebrated
Berlekamp--Welch unique decoder and the (Guruswami--)Sudan list decoders, are
focused on measuring error in the Hamming metric, which simply counts the
number of corrupted codeword symbols. However, for some applications, other
metrics that depend on the specific values of the errors may be more
appropriate.
  This work gives a polynomial-time algorithm that list decodes (generalized)
Reed--Solomon codes over prime fields in $\ell_p$ (semi)metrics, for any $0 < p
\leq 2$. Compared to prior algorithms for the Lee ($\ell_1$) and Euclidean
($\ell_2$) metrics, ours decodes to arbitrarily large distances (for
correspondingly small rates), and has better distance-rate tradeoffs for all
decoding distances above some moderate thresholds. We also prove lower bounds
on the $\ell_{1}$ and $\ell_{2}$ minimum distances of a certain natural
subclass of GRS codes, which establishes that our list decoder is actually a
unique decoder for many parameters of interest. Finally, we analyze our
algorithm's performance under random Laplacian and Gaussian errors, and show
that it supports even larger rates than for corresponding amounts of worst-case
error in $\ell_{1}$ and $\ell_{2}$ (respectively).

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了BLE设备射频指纹识别中的域适应问题，显著提升了识别性能，为物理层安全技术提供了重要支持。

Abstract: Deep learning-based radio frequency fingerprinting (RFFP) has become an
enabling physical-layer security technology, allowing device identification and
authentication through received RF signals. This technology, however, faces
significant challenges when it comes to adapting to domain variations, such as
time, location, environment, receiver and channel. For Bluetooth Low Energy
(BLE) devices, addressing these challenges is particularly crucial due to the
BLE protocol's frequency-hopping nature. In this work, and for the first time,
we investigated the frequency hopping effect on RFFP of BLE devices, and
proposed a novel, low-cost, domain-adaptive feature extraction method. Our
approach improves the classification accuracy by up to 58\% across environments
and up to 80\% across receivers compared to existing benchmarks.

Abstract: Movable antenna (MA) has emerged as a promising technology to flexibly
reconfigure wireless channels by adjusting antenna placement. In this paper, we
study a dual-functional radar-communication (DFRC) system enhanced with movable
antennas. To ensure communication security, we aim to maximize the achievable
sum rate by jointly optimizing the transmit beamforming vectors, receiving
filter, and antenna placement, subject to radar signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)
performance and transmission covertness constraints. To tackle this challenging
optimization problem, we first employ a Lagrangian dual transformation process
to reformulate it into a more tractable form. Subsequently, the problem is
solved by introducing a block coordinate descent (BCD) algorithm, incorporating
semidefinite relaxation (SDR), projected gradient descent (PGD), and successive
convex approximation (SCA) techniques. Simulation results demonstrate that the
proposed method can significantly improve the covert sum rate, and achieve a
satisfactory balance between the communication and radar performance compared
with existing benchmark schemes by leveraging the flexibility of movable
antennas.

*Qiaoyan Peng,Qingqing Wu,Guangji Chen,Wen Chen,Shaodan Ma*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文研究了有源智能反射面(AIRS)辅助的无线通信系统，通过联合优化基站、AIRS波束成形和AIRS元件分配来最大化上下行链路的加权和速率。比较了三种部署方案，并为分布式AIRS推导了最优和近似最优解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统无源智能反射面(PIRS)存在双衰落效应，而有源智能反射面(AIRS)能够放大反射信号，克服这一限制。需要研究AIRS在不同部署方案下的性能表现，特别是在多用户场景下的波束成形优化问题。

Method: 研究了三种部署方案：分布式AIRS、基站侧AIRS和用户侧AIRS。对于分布式AIRS，考虑了用户自适应波束成形和静态波束成形两种设置。开发了基于交替优化(AO)的高效算法来解决非凸优化问题。

Conclusion: 分布式AIRS部署方案在性能上优于其他方案，动态波束成形策略能够有效平衡性能与复杂度之间的权衡，为实际系统设计提供了有价值的指导。

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) aided
wireless communication system, where active IRSs (AIRSs) are deployed to assist
communication between a base station (BS) and users of both the uplink (UL) and
downlink (DL). We aim to maximize the weighted sum rate (WSR) of UL and DL
communications through joint optimization of BS, AIRS beamforming, and AIRS
element allocation. First, we study three deployment schemes, namely
distributed AIRSs, BS-side AIRS, and user-side AIRS. For distributed AIRSs,
both optimal and near-optimal solutions are derived in closed form. To draw
useful insights, we analytically compare the deployment schemes in terms of the
rate performance under the single-user setup. For the multi-user case, we
consider two beamforming setups at the distributed AIRSs to balance performance
and complexity tradeoffs. Regarding the user-adaptive AIRS beamforming,
different AIRS beamforming vectors are adopted for each user; while for the
static AIRS beamforming, all users share the same beamforming vectors, with
identical phase shifts but different amplitudes for UL and DL. With the
user-adaptive AIRS beamforming, we focus on the optimization of element
allocation for rate maximization. With static AIRS beamforming, we solve the
rate maximization problem by optimizing the BS transmit/receive beamformers,
user beamforming, and AIRS beamforming. Despite its non-convexity, we develop
an efficient alternating optimization (AO) based algorithm that solves each
sub-problem optimally. Numerical results validate the practical advantages of
distributed AIRSs compared to passive IRS (PIRS), BS-side AIRS, and user-side
AIRS, and highlight the benefits of dynamic IRS beamforming.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于相位可重构天线的MIMO雷达系统，通过联合优化发射协方差矩阵和收发相位偏移向量来最小化贝叶斯克拉美罗下界，提升目标位置参数估计性能。

Conclusion: 基于相位可重构天线的MIMO雷达系统通过联合优化设计能够充分利用新的设计自由度，在目标位置参数估计方面表现出优越性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a novel multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)
radar system aided by phase shifter based polarization-reconfigurable antennas
(PRAs). Specifically, a base station (BS) equipped with multiple PRAs at both
the transmitter and the receiver aims to sense the unknown and random angular
location parameter of a point target via sending wireless signals and
processing the received echo signals reflected by the target, where only prior
distribution information about the location parameter is available for
exploitation. Firstly, we characterize the sensing performance of this novel
PRA-based MIMO radar system by deriving the Bayesian Cram\'er-Rao bound (BCRB)
of the mean-squared error (MSE) in estimating the desired location parameter
with prior distribution information. Then, to fully exploit the new design
degrees-of-freedom (DoF) empowered by PRAs, we study the joint optimization of
the transmit sample covariance matrix as well as the transmit and receive phase
shift vectors to minimize the sensing BCRB subject to a transmit power
constraint. This problem is non-convex and difficult to solve due to the
coupling among optimization variables. To resolve this issue, we develop an
alternating optimization (AO) based algorithm which iteratively obtains the

Abstract: In nature, signals often appear in the form of the superposition of multiple
non-stationary signals. The overlap of signal components in the time-frequency
domain poses a significant challenge for signal analysis. One approach to
addressing this problem is to introduce an additional chirprate parameter and
use the chirplet transform (CT) to elevate the two-dimensional time-frequency
representation to a three-dimensional time-frequency-chirprate representation.
From a certain point of view, the CT of a signal can be regarded as a windowed
special linear canonical transform of that signal, undergoing a shift and a
modulation.
  In this paper, we develop this idea to propose a novel windowed linear
canonical transform (WLCT), which provides a new time-frequency-chirprate
representation. We discuss four types of WLCTs. In addition, we use a special
X-ray transform to further sharpen the time-frequency-chirprate representation.
Furthermore, we derive the corresponding three-dimensional synchrosqueezed
transform, demonstrating that the WLCTs have great potential for
three-dimensional signal separation.

TL;DR: 提出了一种五能级多载波里德堡原子量子接收器(MC-RAQR)，解决了传统RAQR带宽受限问题，实现了14MHz带宽，比传统RAQR提升56倍，显著提高了多载波通信和感知性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统里德堡原子量子接收器(RAQR)虽然灵敏度高，但由于原子能级的离散性和固有瞬时带宽限制，无法准确接收宽带射频信号，这限制了其在多载波通信和感知中的应用。

Method: 设计五能级多载波里德堡原子量子接收器结构，推导其幅度和相位响应，提取基带电信号进行处理，分析信道容量和到达角、距离参数的感知精度。

Result: MC-RAQR实现了14MHz带宽，比传统RAQR提升56倍；信道容量分别是传统天线和RAQR的22倍和3倍；到达角估计的MSE仅为传统RAQR的0.16%，距离估计MSE为传统天线CRB的0.01%。

Conclusion: MC-RAQR与OFDM等波形兼容，在多载波信号接收方面具有显著优势，显著提升了多载波通信和感知性能。

Abstract: Rydberg atomic quantum receivers (RAQRs) have attracted significant attention
in recent years due to their ultra-high sensitivity. Although capable of
precisely detecting the amplitude and phase of weak signals, conventional RAQRs
face inherent limitations in accurately receiving wideband RF signals, due to
the discrete nature of atomic energy levels and their intrinsic instantaneous
bandwidth constraints. These limitations hinder their direct application to
multi-carrier communication and sensing. To address this issue, this paper
proposes a multi-carrier Rydberg atomic quantum receiver (MC-RAQR) structure
with five energy levels. We derive the amplitude and phase of the MC-RAQR and
extract the baseband electrical signal for signal processing. In terms of
multi-carrier communication and sensing, we analyze the channel capacity and
accuracy of angle of arrival (AoA) and distance parameters, respectively.
Numerical results validate our proposed model, showing that the MC-RAQR can
achieve up to a bandwidth of 14 MHz, which is 56-fold larger than the
conventional RAQRs. As a result, the channel capacity and the resolution for
multi-target sensing are improved significantly. Specifically, the channel
capacity of MC-RAQR is 22-fold and 3-fold larger than the conventional antennas
and RAQRs, respectively. For sensing performance, the MSE of AoA estimation for
MC-RAQR is 0.16% of the conventional RAQR and the MSE of distance estimation is
0.01% of the CRB of conventional antennas, showing the superior performance of
the MC-RAQR. This demonstrates its compatibility with waveforms such as
orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) and its significant
advantages for multi-carrier signal reception.

synergistic optimization between transform domain construction and filtering
operations. The proposed method not only eliminates the cumbersome grid search
required by traditional strategies but also significantly enhances the

results on real-world graph data show the proposed method outperforms existing
methods in denoising tasks, featuring superior denoising performance, higher
robustness and lower computational complexity.

Conclusion: 提出的UGRM-GFT方法能够有效适应复杂图结构，在信号处理性能上优于传统方法，且具有计算效率优势。

Abstract: Traditional directed graph signal processing generally depends on fixed
representation matrices, whose rigid structures limit the model's ability to
adapt to complex graph topologies. To address this issue, this study employed
the unified graph representation matrix (UGRM) to propose a generalized graph
Fourier transform (UGRM-GFT) method based on singular value decomposition (SVD)
for signal analysis on directed graphs and Cartesian product graphs. We defined
UGRM-GFT for general directed graphs by introducing a parameterized UGRM that
incorporates traditional representations such as the Laplacian matrix and
adjacency matrix. The SVD is used to construct spectral transform pairs with
both left and right singular vectors. We extended this approach to two types of
UGRM-GFTs applied to directed Cartesian product graphs. UGRM-GFT-I performs SVD
directly on the composite UGRM matrix of the two-dimensional graph structure,
suitable for globally coupled graph signals. UGRM-GFT-II separately applies SVD
to the UGRMs of the two-factor graphs and then combines the results,
significantly reducing computational complexity while preserving spectral
expressiveness. Theoretical analysis confirmed the monotonicity of the proposed
method with respect to the parameters alpha and k embedded in the UGRM.
Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrated that the proposed
method significantly outperforms traditional fixed-matrix approaches in
denoising tasks, with a particular emphasis on signal-to-noise ratio and
bandwidth efficiency.

combining multiple radar viewpoints with signal integration enables stable

Conclusion: 基于大语言模型的CPLLM和BFLLM框架能够有效解决LEO卫星通信中的信道预测和波束成形问题，具有优异的泛化能力和推理性能。

Abstract: Accurate channel prediction and effective beamforming are essential for low
Earth orbit (LEO) satellite communications to enhance system capacity and
enable high-speed connectivity. Most existing channel prediction and predictive
beamforming methods are limited by model generalization capabilities and
struggle to adapt to time-varying wireless propagation environments. Inspired
by the remarkable generalization and reasoning capabilities of large language
models (LLMs), this work proposes an LLM-based channel prediction framework,
namely CPLLM, to forecast future channel state information (CSI) for LEO
satellites based on historical CSI data. In the proposed CPLLM, a dedicated CSI
encoder is designed to map raw CSI data into the textual embedding space,
effectively bridging the modality gap and enabling the LLM to perform reliable
reasoning over CSI data. Additionally, a CSI decoder is introduced to
simultaneously predict CSI for multiple future time slots, substantially
reducing the computational burden and inference latency associated with the
inherent autoregressive decoding process of LLMs. Then, instead of training the
LLM from scratch, we adopt a parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategy, i.e.,
LoRA, for CPLLM, where the pretrained LLM remains frozen and trainable low-rank
matrices are injected into each Transformer decoder layer to enable effective
fine-tuning. Furthermore, we extend CPLLM to directly generate beamforming
strategies for future time slots based on historical CSI data, namely BFLLM.
This extended framework retains the same architecture as CPLLM, while
introducing a dedicated beamforming decoder to output beamforming strategies.
Finally, extensive simulation results validate the effectiveness of the
proposed approaches in channel prediction and predictive beamforming for LEO
satellite communications.

Abstract: This paper proposes an integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system
covert waveform design method for complex clutter environments, with the core
objective of maximizing the signal-to-clutter-plus-noise ratio (SCNR). The
design achieves efficient clutter suppression while meeting the covertness
requirement through joint optimization of the transmit waveform and receive
filter, enabling cooperative radar detection and wireless communication. This
study presents key innovations that explicitly address target Doppler shift
uncertainty, significantly enhancing system robustness against Doppler effects.
To ensure communication reliability, the method incorporates phase difference
constraints between communication signal elements in the waveform design, along
with energy constraint, covert constraint, and peak-to-average power ratio
(PAPR) constraint. The original non-convex optimization problem is transformed
into a tractable convex optimization form through convex optimization
technique. Simulation results demonstrate that the optimized waveform not only
satisfies the covertness requirement in complex clutter environment, but also
achieves superior target detection performance. It also ensures reliable
communication and confirms the effectiveness of propose method.

Conclusion: 混合波束成形在FR3频段基站中能够提供高数据速率的同时显著改善能效，是6G网络中有前景的架构选择。

Abstract: Increasing attention is given to the upper mid-band or Frequency Range 3
(FR3), from 7 to 24 GHz, in the research towards sixth-generation (6G)
networks. Promises of offering large data rates at favorable propagation
conditions are leading to novel FR3 base station (BS) architectures, with up to
thousands of antenna elements and radio-frequency (RF) chains. This work
investigates the power consumption of prospective FR3 BSs and its relation to
the delivered data rates. We model the power consumed by digital and analog
signal processing, power amplifiers (PAs), and supply and cooling during four
phases (data, signaling, micro-sleep, and idle) in downlink and uplink. Hybrid
partially-connected beamforming is compared to fully-digital one. Results show
that, for BS arrays with $1024$ antennas at $30\%$ of load, the PA consumes
most of the power when $64$ or less RF chains are utilized, while the digital
and analog processing consumption takes over when the number of RF chains is
$512$ or more. The digital plus analog processing consumes $2\times$ to
$4\times$ more than the PA for fully-digital beamforming. Hybrid beamforming
achieves $1.3$ Gbit/s/user in downlink while improving the energy efficiency by
$1.4\times$ compared to fully-digital beamforming.

Result: 在低信噪比相干源场景下，比最先进方法准确度提高约35.39%；在嵌入式NVIDIA Jetson Xavier NX平台上，比竞争神经网络基线能耗降低约93%

Conclusion: HYPERDOA在精度和效率上的双重优势，使其成为边缘设备上任务关键应用的稳健可行解决方案

Abstract: Direction of Arrival (DoA) estimation techniques face a critical trade-off,
as classical methods often lack accuracy in challenging, low signal-to-noise
ratio (SNR) conditions, while modern deep learning approaches are too
energy-intensive and opaque for resource-constrained, safety-critical systems.
We introduce HYPERDOA, a novel estimator leveraging Hyperdimensional Computing
(HDC). The framework introduces two distinct feature extraction strategies --
Mean Spatial-Lag Autocorrelation and Spatial Smoothing -- for its HDC pipeline,
and then reframes DoA estimation as a pattern recognition problem. This
approach leverages HDC's inherent robustness to noise and its transparent
algebraic operations to bypass the expensive matrix decompositions and
``black-box'' nature of classical and deep learning methods, respectively. Our
evaluation demonstrates that HYPERDOA achieves ~35.39% higher accuracy than
state-of-the-art methods in low-SNR, coherent-source scenarios. Crucially, it
also consumes ~93% less energy than competing neural baselines on an embedded
NVIDIA Jetson Xavier NX platform. This dual advantage in accuracy and
efficiency establishes HYPERDOA as a robust and viable solution for
mission-critical applications on edge devices.

Firstly, the field of view (FoV) is divided into angular sectors according to
the frequency beam-scanning property of LWAs, and Bayesian inverse problems are
then solved within each sector to improve efficiency and reduce computational
cost. Both on-grid SBL and off-grid SBL formulations are developed. Simulation

Abstract: Acquiring accurate channel state information (CSI) is critical for reliable
and efficient wireless communication, but challenges such as high pilot
overhead and channel aging hinder timely and accurate CSI acquisition. CSI
prediction, which forecasts future CSI from historical observations, offers a
promising solution. Recent deep learning approaches, including recurrent neural
networks and Transformers, have achieved notable success but typically learn
deterministic mappings, limiting their ability to capture the stochastic and
multimodal nature of wireless channels. In this paper, we introduce a novel
probabilistic framework for CSI prediction based on diffusion models, offering
a flexible design that supports integration of diverse prediction schemes. We
decompose the CSI prediction task into two components: a temporal encoder,
which extracts channel dynamics, and a diffusion-based generator, which
produces future CSI samples. We investigate two inference
schemes-autoregressive and sequence-to-sequence- and explore multiple diffusion
backbones, including U-Net and Transformer-based architectures. Furthermore, we
examine a diffusion-based approach without an explicit temporal encoder and
utilize the DDIM scheduling to reduce model complexity. Extensive simulations
demonstrate that our diffusion-based models significantly outperform
state-of-the-art baselines.

Abstract: Direction-of-Arrival (DOA) estimation in sensor arrays faces limitations
under demanding conditions, including low signal-to-noise ratio,
single-snapshot scenarios, coherent sources, and unknown source counts.
Conventional beamforming suffers from sidelobe interference, adaptive methods
(e.g., MVDR) and subspace algorithms (e.g., MUSIC) degrade with limited
snapshots or coherent signals, while sparse-recovery approaches (e.g., L1-SVD)
incur high computational complexity for large arrays. In this article, we
construct the concept of the optimal spatial filter to solve the DOA estimation
problem under demanding conditions by utilizing the sparsity of spatial
signals. By utilizing the concept of the optimal spatial filter, we have
transformed the DOA estimation problem into a solution problem for the optimal
spatial filter. We propose the Spatial Signal Focusing and Noise Suppression
(SSFNS) algorithm, which is a novel DOA estimation framework grounded in the
theoretical existence of an optimal spatial filter, to solve for the optimal
spatial filter and obtain DOA. Through experiments, it was found that the
proposed algorithm is suitable for large aperture two-dimensional arrays and
experiments have shown that our proposed algorithm performs better than other
algorithms in scenarios with few snapshots or even a single snapshot, low
signal-to-noise ratio, coherent signals, and unknown signal numbers in
two-dimensional large aperture arrays.

Abstract: Real-time and contactless monitoring of vital signs, such as respiration and
heartbeat, alongside reliable communication, is essential for modern healthcare
systems, especially in remote and privacy-sensitive environments. Traditional
wireless communication and sensing networks fall short in meeting all the
stringent demands of eHealth, including accurate sensing, high data efficiency,
and privacy preservation. To overcome the challenges, we propose a novel
integrated sensing, computing, and semantic communication (ISCSC) framework. In
the proposed system, a service robot utilises radar to detect patient positions
and monitor their vital signs, while sending updates to the medical devices.
Instead of transmitting raw physiological information, the robot computes and
communicates semantically extracted health features to medical devices. This
semantic processing improves data throughput and preserves the clinical
relevance of the messages, while enhancing data privacy by avoiding the
transmission of sensitive data. Leveraging the estimated patient locations, the
robot employs an interacting multiple model (IMM) filter to actively track
patient motion, thereby enabling robust beam steering for continuous and
reliable monitoring. We then propose a joint optimisation of the beamforming
matrices and the semantic extraction ratio, subject to computing capability and
power budget constraints, with the objective of maximising both the semantic
secrecy rate and sensing accuracy. Simulation results validate that the ISCSC
framework achieves superior sensing accuracy, improved semantic transmission
efficiency, and enhanced privacy preservation compared to conventional joint
sensing and communication methods.

Abstract: Pinching antennas (PAs), as an emerging flexible-antenna technology, enables
movable PAs deployed along waveguides to customize channel conditions over a
large scale. This paper investigates an application of PAs to enable
physical-layer security (PLS) by enlarging the channel condition diversity
between legitimate users (LUs) and eavesdroppers (Eves). Particularly, we focus
on the dual-waveguide scenario, where the two waveguides employs multiple PAs
to serve multiple LUs in the presence of an Eve. Specifically, we consider two
waveguide placement strategies, i.e., parallel placement and orthogonal
placement. Meanwhile, we incorporate two channel models, i.e., in-waveguide
phase shifts, and in-waveguide phase shifts and attenuation. We formulate the
secure sum rate (SSR) and secure energy efficiency (SEE) maximization problems,
and propose a two-stage algorithm to solve them. The first stage adopts a
particle swarm optimization (PSO) method with an improved feasibility module,
termed FeaPSO, for PA placement, and the second stage employs the successive
convex approximate (SCA) method to optimize beamforming and artificial noise
vectors. Furthermore, we conduct numerical comparisons between the two
placement strategies in terms of average performance and a special case where
an Eve is positioned in front of LUs. Numerical results validate the
effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and demonstrate that PAs can
significantly improve both SSR and SEE. Additionally, the necessity of
orthogonal waveguide placement is explicitly verified.

Conclusion: 新框架克服了UatF边界的局限性，为大规模MIMO系统提供了更准确的功率控制方法。

Abstract: We introduce mathematical tools and fixed point algorithms for optimal
statistical max-min power control in cellular and cell-less massive MIMO
systems. Unlike previous studies that rely on the use-and-then-forget (UatF)
lower bound on Shannon achievable (ergodic) rates, our proposed framework can
deal with alternative bounds that explicitly consider perfect or imperfect
channel state information (CSI) at the decoder. In doing so, we address
limitations of UatF-based algorithms, which inherit the shortcomings of the
UatF bound. For example, the UatF bound can be overly conservative: in extreme
cases, under fully statistical (nonadaptive) beamforming in zero-mean channels,
the UatF bound produces trivial (zero) rate bounds. It also lacks scale
invariance: merely scaling the beamformers can change the bound drastically,
especially when simple beamforming strategies are employed. In contrast, our
framework is compatible with information-theoretic bounds that do not suffer
from the above drawbacks. We illustrate the framework by solving a max-min
power control problem considering a standard bound that exploits instantaneous
CSI at the decoder.

Abstract: Electromagnetic (EM) communication is nearing its physical and thermodynamic
limits, where further performance gains through spectrum optimization alone
have become increasingly unsustainable. Finite bandwidth, propagation loss at
higher frequencies, and the inherent trade-offs between energy and information
constrain the scalability of 6G and beyond systems. These limitations drive the
search for alternative mechanisms for information transfer beyond conventional
EM propagation. This work introduces a state-centric framework for post-6G
communication, in which information is conveyed by manipulating physical,
biological, and cognitive states rather than EM waves. It identifies ten
foundational paradigms that define potential carriers and interaction
mechanisms for the post-electromagnetic era and outlines a research roadmap
toward self-organizing, cognitively integrated networks. Together, these
developments envision a new class of communication systems that are
energy-aware, adaptive, and capable of uniting matter, life, and intelligence
within a single informational continuum. By establishing the conceptual basis
for this transition, the work provides a foundation for future research aimed
at realizing communication paradigms that transcend the limitations of
spectrum-bound systems.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) technology offers significant
promise in enhancing wireless communication systems, but its dual-use potential
also introduces substantial security risks. This survey explores the security
implications of RIS in next-generation wireless networks. We first highlight
the dual-use nature of RIS, demonstrating how its communication-enhancing
capabilities can be exploited by adversaries to compromise legitimate users. We
identify a new class of security vulnerabilities termed ``passive-active hybrid
attacks,'' where RIS, despite passively handling signals, can be reconfigured
to actively engage in malicious activities, enabling various RIS-assisted
attacks, such as eavesdropping, man-in-the-middle (MITM), replay, reflection
jamming, and side-channel attacks. Furthermore, we reveal how adversaries can
exploit the openness of wireless channels to introduce adversarial
perturbations in artificial intelligence-driven RIS networks, disrupting
communication terminals and causing misclassifications or errors in RIS
reflection predictions. Despite these risks, RIS technology also plays a
critical role in enhancing security and privacy across radio frequency (RF) and
visible light communication (VLC) systems. By synthesizing current insights and
highlighting emerging threats, we provide actionable insights into cross-layer
collaboration, advanced adversarial defenses, and the balance between security
and cost. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of RIS technology's
security landscape and underscores the urgent need for robust security
frameworks in the development of future wireless systems.

Motivation: 为未来6G网络中集成感知与通信系统提供波形选择的统一分析框架，解决不同波形在感知性能方面的系统性比较问题。

Method: 直接从离散时间定义获取各波形的模糊函数，通过理想分数插值增强，在归一化时延-多普勒单位下评估模糊函数和性能指标（3dB主瓣宽度、PSLR、ISLR）。

Result: 建立了波形感知能力的统一基准：OFDM具有优异的时延分辨率和旁瓣特性但多普勒响应差，而先进波形在时延和多普勒分辨率之间实现更好平衡。

Conclusion: 该分析为ISAC波形设计提供了系统性的比较基准，揭示了不同波形在感知性能方面的权衡特性，并公开了仿真代码以促进可重复性和未来研究。

Abstract: This paper presents a unified and system-agnostic analysis of the ambiguity
function (AF) characteristics of four representative multicarrier waveforms,
orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), orthogonal time frequency
space (OTFS), affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM), and chirp-permuted
AFDM (CP-AFDM), which are considered as key candidates for enabling integrated
sensing and communications (ISAC) in future sixth generation (6G) networks. The
AF of each waveform is obtained directly from its discrete-time definition and
enhanced via ideal fractional interpolation, enabling precise characterization
of its continuous-time delay-Doppler response. Two signaling modes are
examined: a communication-oriented case with random information symbols
suitable only for monostatic scenarios, and a sensing-oriented case with fixed
unimodular symbols suitable for general multi-static scenarios. Furthermore,
the AFs and the ambiguity metrics including the 3dB mainlobe width,
peak-to-sidelobe ratio (PSLR), and integrated sidelobe ratio (ISLR), are
evaluated in normalized delay-Doppler units, enabling direct translation to any
physical system configuration defined by bandwidth, sampling frequency, or
symbol duration, while ensuring straightforward and consistent comparison
across waveforms. The results establish a consistent benchmark for comparing
waveform sensing capabilities in ISAC design, consolidating known behaviors:
OFDM exhibits excellent delay resolution and sidelobe behavior but poor Doppler
response, whereas advanced waveforms achieve improved balance between delay and
Doppler resolution with varying sidelobe characteristics. The simulation code
of the smooth AFs, is openly shared to promote reproducibility and support
future ISAC waveform research.

Conclusion: 2D-GBFRFT在图信号处理滤波中展现出多功能性和优越性能。

Abstract: Graph signal processing (GSP) advances spectral analysis on irregular
domains. However, existing two-dimensional graph fractional Fourier transform
(2D-GFRFT) employs a single fractional order for both factor graphs, thereby
limiting its adaptability to heterogeneous signals. We proposed the
two-dimensional graph bi-fractional Fourier transform (2D-GBFRFT), which
assigns independent fractional orders to the factor graphs of a Cartesian
product while preserving separability. We established invertibility, unitarity,
and index additivity, and developed two filtering schemes: a Wiener-style
design through grid search and a differentiable framework that jointly
optimizes transform orders and diagonal spectral filters. We further introduced
a hybrid interpolation with the joint time-vertex fractional Fourier transform
(JFRFT), controlled by a tunable parameter that balances the two methods. In
the domains of synthetic Cartesian product graph signals, authentic temporal
graph datasets, and dynamic image deblurring, 2D-GBFRFT consistently surpasses
2D-GFRFT and enhances JFRFT. Experimental results confirmed the versatility and
superior performance of 2D-GBFRFT for filtering in GSP.

Conclusion: CaSIP框架通过有效利用大尺度信道状态信息，成功解决了叠加导频方案中的导频数据干扰问题，为移动通信系统提供了更优的性能。

Abstract: Superimposed pilot (SIP) schemes face significant challenges in effectively
superimposing and separating pilot and data signals, especially in multiuser
mobility scenarios with rapidly varying channels. To address these challenges,
we propose a novel channel-aware learning framework for SIP schemes, termed
CaSIP, that jointly optimizes pilot-data power (PDP) allocation and a receiver
network for pilot-data interference (PDI) elimination, by leveraging channel
path gain information, a form of large-scale channel state information (CSI).
The proposed framework identifies user-specific, resource element-wise PDP
factors and develops a deep neural network-based SIP receiver comprising
explicit channel estimation and data detection components. To properly leverage
path gain data, we devise an embedding generator that projects it into
embeddings, which are then fused with intermediate feature maps of the channel
estimation network. Simulation results demonstrate that CaSIP efficiently
outperforms traditional pilot schemes and state-of-the-art SIP schemes in terms
of sum throughput and channel estimation accuracy, particularly under
high-mobility and low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions.

Motivation: 智能路边单元监控道路时，发现特定车辆需要执行规避动作，但不知道哪个IP地址对应视频中的哪辆车，这是车联网中的一个基本开放性问题。

Method: 采用动态水印技术，要求车辆在转向角或油门/刹车控制指令上叠加小型随机激励信号，并将该随机波形连同IP地址发送给RSU，RSU通过视频流信号处理验证波形匹配来关联IP地址与车辆。

Conclusion: 动态水印技术有效解决了车联网中车辆身份识别问题，实现了RSU对视频中特定车辆与IP地址的准确关联。

Abstract: We consider a problem faced by an intelligent roadside unit (RSU) monitoring
a roadway by a video camera. Suppose the RSU notices that a particular car in
its visual field needs to execute a specific evasive maneuver to avoid danger.
It would like to send a packet addressed to that particular car with this
suggestion. The problem is that while all the cars are communicating with the
RSU, the RSU does not know which car in the video is associated with what IP
address. So, it does not know which IP address to send the packet to. Indeed,
the problem of matching addresses with cars in the visual field is a
fundamental open problem. We provide an active solution employing dynamic
watermarking that was originally developed for the security of cyber-physical
systems. This technique calls for a car to superpose a small random excitation
onto its actuation commands for steering angle or throttle/brake positions. The
car sends this random waveform to the RSU in a packet containing its IP
address. By signal processing of the video stream of a car at the RSU it can
verify whether it matches with the waveform in the packet and thereby
associates that the IP address of the packet with that car in the visual field.
The RSU thereby determines which IP address is associated with which car in its
visual field. We present two demonstrations of performance. We demonstrate
experimental results on a laboratory transportation automated vehicles, a
vision system, and a network, as well as on the field with two passenger sedans
in practice. The results demonstrate that employing the dynamic watermarking
method enables an RSU to distinguish the communication of a target vehicle from
that of other IP addresses of nearby vehicles.

Conclusion: CIRSense通过利用CIR的延迟域优势，显著提升了WiFi感知的性能和可解释性，在远距离、多目标等复杂场景下表现出卓越性能。

Abstract: WiFi sensing based on channel state information (CSI) collected from
commodity WiFi devices has shown great potential across a wide range of
applications, including vital sign monitoring and indoor localization. Existing
WiFi sensing approaches typically estimate motion information directly from
CSI. However, they often overlook the inherent advantages of channel impulse
response (CIR), a delay-domain representation that enables more intuitive and
principled motion sensing by naturally concentrating motion energy and
separating multipath components. Motivated by this, we revisit WiFi sensing and
introduce CIRSense, a new framework that enhances the performance and
interpretability of WiFi sensing with CIR. CIRSense is built upon a new motion
model that characterizes fractional delay effects, a fundamental challenge in
CIR-based sensing. This theoretical model underpins technical advances for the
three challenges in WiFi sensing: hardware distortion compensation,
high-resolution distance estimation, and subcarrier aggregation for extended
range sensing. CIRSense, operating with a 160 MHz channel bandwidth,
demonstrates versatile sensing capabilities through its dual-mode design,
achieving a mean error of approximately 0.25 bpm in respiration monitoring and
0.09 m in distance estimation. Comprehensive evaluations across residential
spaces, far-range scenarios, and multi-target settings demonstrate CIRSense's
superior performance over state-of-the-art CSI-based baselines. Notably, at a
challenging sensing distance of 20 m, CIRSense achieves at least 3x higher
average accuracy with more than 4.5x higher computational efficiency.

Conclusion: 虽然FIR滤波器的输出不确定性不能假设为高斯分布，但高斯估计在某些应用中仍然有用，且输出不确定性分布可以通过主导系数进行估计。

Abstract: A common assumption in signal processing is that underlying data numerically
conforms to a Gaussian distribution. It is commonly utilized in signal
processing to describe unknown additive noise in a system and is often
justified by citing the central limit theorem for sums of random variables,
although the central limit theorem applies only to sums of independent
identically distributed random variables. However, many linear operations in
signal processing take the form of weighted sums, which transforms the random
variables such that their distributions are no longer identical. One such
operation is a finite impulse response (FIR) filter. FIR filters are commonly
used in signal processing applications as a pre-processing step. FIR output
noise is generally assumed to be Gaussian. This article examines the FIR output
response in the presence of uniformly distributed quantization noise. We
express the FIR output uncertainty in terms of the input quantization
uncertainty and filter coefficients. We show that the output uncertainty cannot
be assumed to be Gaussian, but depending on the application a Gaussian
estimation may still be useful. Then, we show through detailed numerical
simulations that the output uncertainty distribution of the filter can be
estimated through its most dominant coefficients.

incorporating position and attitude information into the beamforming process,
nominal performance can be effectively restored. These findings support the
development of control-aware beamforming strategies that tightly integrate the
attitude and orbit control system with signal processing to enable robust
beamforming and autonomous coordination.

Abstract: Accurate channel estimation is essential for both high-rate communication and
high-precision sensing in 6G wireless systems. However, a major performance
limitation arises from calibration mismatches when operating phased-array
antennas under real-world conditions. To address this issue, we propose to
integrate antenna element self-calibration into a variational sparse Bayesian
learning (VSBL) algorithm for parametric channel estimation. We model antenna
gain and phase deviations as latent variables and derive explicit update
equations to jointly infer these calibration parameters and the channel
parameters: the model order, complex amplitudes, delays, angles, and the noise
variance. The resulting algorithm operates online and adapts in real time to
hardware-induced mismatches. We assess its performance in terms of the root
mean square error (RMSE) and the optimal subpattern-assignment (OSPA) metric,
demonstrating consistent improvements over conventional VSBL without
calibration. Our results demonstrate that embedding self-calibration within
Bayesian inference significantly enhances the robustness of channel estimation.

Abstract: The ever-growing demand for ultra-high data rates, massive connectivity, and

a promising candidate for sub-THz systems due to their simple feed structure,
low fabrication cost, and inherent angle-frequency coupling, which enables
frequency-controlled beamsteering with simple hardware. In this article, we
review the fundamentals of the LWA technology, highlight their unique
properties, and showcase their potential in multi-user wideband sub-THz
wireless communications. We present representative studies demonstrating that
LWAs can simultaneously support high-rate multi-user communications and
accurate localization using only a single antenna element. Finally, several key
open challenges are outlined, spanning algorithm design, signal processing,
information theory, standardization, and hardware implementation, that need to
be addressed to fully harness LWAs as a cost-effective and scalable enabler of
next generations of wireless systems.
