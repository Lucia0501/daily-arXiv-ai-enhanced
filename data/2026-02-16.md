### [1] [A Gradient Boosted Mixed-Model Machine Learning Framework for Vessel Speed in the U.S. Arctic](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12292)
*Mauli Pant,Linda Fernandez,Indranil Sahoo*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 使用两阶段机器学习框架分析北极船舶速度：第一阶段预测速度大于零的概率，第二阶段预测正速度值，发现海岸距离和水深是主要影响因素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解环境和操作条件如何影响船舶速度对北极航行条件表征至关重要，但超过一半的AIS记录显示零速度，将零速度和正速度作为单一连续过程处理会掩盖重要模式。

Method: 采用两阶段机器学习框架：1) 使用梯度提升决策树建模速度大于零的概率；2) 建模正速度条件分布。整合AIS数据与海冰浓度、航向、风、水深、海岸距离、船舶类型和航行状态等变量，使用SHAP值量化协变量效应。

Result: 正速度分类器取得强区分能力(AUC=0.85)，条件速度模型解释约77%的样本外方差。海岸距离和水深是船舶速度可能性和大小的主要决定因素，航向变化、船舶类型和航行状态引入次要变异，风和海冰效应相对较小。

Conclusion: 该研究实证表征了北极船舶运行机制，为速度管理和走廊级评估提供了重要参考，两阶段建模方法有效处理了零速度数据问题，揭示了环境因素对船舶速度的复杂影响。

Abstract: Understanding how environmental and operational conditions influence vessel speed is crucial for characterizing navigational conditions in the Arctic. We analyzed Automatic Identification System (AIS) data from 2010-2019 to examine vessel speed over ground (SOG). Over half of the AIS records showed zero SOG, and treating zero and positive SOG as a single continuous process can obscure important patterns. We therefore applied a two-stage machine learning framework, first modeling the probability of SOG greater than zero and then modeling SOG conditional on being positive. AIS observations were integrated with sea ice concentration, course over ground, wind, bathymetric depth, distance to coast, vessel group, and navigational status. Gradient boosted decision trees with random effects captured nonlinear environmental responses while accounting for repeated observations. The positive SOG classifier achieved strong discrimination (AUC = 0.85), while the conditional speed model explained approximately 77 percent of out-of-fold variance. SHAP values quantified covariate effects by decomposing model predictions into additive contributions from individual variables. Distance to coast and bathymetric depth were dominant determinants of both the likelihood and magnitude of vessel speed, while changes in course, vessel group, and navigational status introduced secondary variation. Wind and sea ice effects were modest. Together, these results empirically characterize Arctic vessel operating regimes relevant to speed management and corridor-level assessment.

Conclusion: IR-NCOTA方案成功解决了NCOTA易受外部干扰的问题，通过协调随机旋转和伪随机导频技术，将干扰转化为零均值分布，保持了共识估计的无偏性，从而确保了去中心化优化算法的收敛保证。

Abstract: Non-coherent over-the-air (NCOTA) computation enables low-latency and bandwidth-efficient decentralized optimization by exploiting the average energy superposition property of wireless channels. It has recently been proposed as a powerful tool for executing consensus-based optimization algorithms in fully decentralized systems. A key advantage of NCOTA is that it enables unbiased consensus estimation without channel state information at either transmitters or receivers, requires no transmission scheduling, and scales efficiently to dense network deployments. However, NCOTA is inherently susceptible to external interference, which can bias the consensus estimate and deteriorate the convergence of the underlying decentralized optimization algorithm. In this paper, we propose a novel interference-robust (IR-)NCOTA scheme. The core idea is to apply a coordinated random rotation of the frame of reference across all nodes, and transmit a pseudo-random pilot signal, allowing to transform external interference into a circularly symmetric distribution with zero mean relative to the rotated frame. This ensures that the consensus estimates remain unbiased, preserving the convergence guarantees of the underlying optimization algorithm. Through numerical results on a classification task, it is demonstrated that IR-NCOTA exhibits superior performance over the baseline NCOTA algorithm in the presence of external interference.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 实验证明随机配置的RIS在5G NR系统中能提供接近最优的性能，通过PF调度机制自动选择信道条件最好的UE，无需复杂优化


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究RIS在真实5G NR系统中的实际性能增益，探索是否可以通过简单随机配置而非复杂优化来获得接近最优的性能

Method: 使用OpenAirInterface框架构建实时5G NR系统，集成自建可重构智能表面，通过实验测量吞吐量增益，分析随机RIS相位配置结合5G NR的PF调度机制的效果

Result: 随机配置RIS结合PF调度能实现接近最优的吞吐量，当PF调度器的吞吐量平均窗口选择适当时，系统会自动优先服务信道条件最好的UE；实验测量的RSRP、BLER、MCS和吞吐量指标显示随机RIS配置性能与优化设计相当

Conclusion: 随机配置的RIS在真实5G NR系统中能以可忽略的开销提供与优化设计相当的性能，这得益于5G NR的PF调度机制能自动选择与随机RIS对齐的UE进行数据传输

Abstract: We experimentally demonstrate the performance gains achieved by an in-house built reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) integrated with a real-time 5G new radio (NR) system implemented using the OpenAirInterface (OAI) framework. We first quantify the gain in throughput achievable by integrating an RIS with a 5G system. Next, we show that randomly setting the RIS phase configuration and leveraging the inherent proportional fair (PF) scheduling mechanism of 5G NR can yield near-optimal throughput, provided the throughput averaging window of the PF scheduler is chosen judiciously. This occurs because, in each time slot, the PF scheduler naturally prioritizes data transmission to the user equipment (UE) that experiences the best channel conditions, namely, the UE to which the randomly configured RIS is aligned. Subsequently, we experimentally evaluate key performance metrics, including the reference signal received power (RSRP), block error rate (BLER), modulation and coding scheme (MCS) index, and throughput, under random RIS configurations. These results confirm that even a randomly configured RIS with negligible overhead can deliver performance comparable to optimized RIS designs, in real-world 5G NR wireless communication systems.

### [4] [Task- and Metric-Specific Signal Quality Indices for Medical Time Series](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12478)
*Jad Haidamous,Christoph Hoog Antink*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出基于扰动的信号质量指数(pSQI)，通过添加有色高斯噪声来检测算法性能下降，相比现有方法在R波检测和房颤分类任务上表现更优且无需训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗时间序列信号(如ECG、PPG)常受测量伪影影响，现有信号质量指数大多与具体任务无关，无法反映下游算法和性能指标的特定需求，需要任务和指标相关的信号质量评估方法。

Method: 提出扰动式信号质量指数(pSQI)，定义为在满足信噪比下限的有色高斯加性噪声扰动下，性能指标的最坏情况值。引入任务和指标特定SQI的形式化要求，包括期望单调性和阈值化下的最大分离度。

Result: 在R波检测和房颤分类基准测试中，pSQI在识别不可靠输入方面持续优于现有的基于特征和深度学习的SQI方法，且无需训练过程。

Conclusion: 信号质量应定义为任务和指标相关的概念，提出的pSQI方法能有效检测算法性能下降，为医疗时间序列分析提供更可靠的信号质量评估工具。

Abstract: Medical time series such as electrocardiograms (ECGs) and photoplethysmograms (PPGs) are frequently affected by measurement artifacts due to challenging acquisition environments, such as in ambulances and during routine daily activities. Since automated algorithms for analyzing such signals increasingly inform clinically relevant decisions, identifying signal segments on which these algorithms may produce unreliable outputs is of critical importance. Signal quality indices (SQIs) are commonly used for this purpose. However, most existing SQIs are task agnostic and do not account for the specific algorithm and performance metric used downstream. In this work, we formalize signal quality as a task- and metric-dependent concept and propose a perturbation-based SQI (pSQI) that aims to detect an algorithm's performance degradation on an input signal with respect to a metric. The pSQI is defined as the worst-case value of the performance metric under an additive, colored Gaussian noise perturbation with a lower-bounded signal-to-noise ratio. We introduce formal requirements for task- and metric-specific SQIs, including monotonicity of the metric in expectation and maximal separation under thresholding. Experiments on R-peak detection and atrial fibrillation classification benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed pSQI consistently outperforms existing feature- and deep learning-based SQIs in identifying unreliable inputs without requiring training.

### [5] [Generative Site-Specific Beamforming via Information-Maximizing Codebook](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12552)
*Cheng-Jie Zhao,Zhaolin Wang,Yuanwei Liu*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出GenSSBF框架，通过SIM码本和CFM生成模型，利用少量RSRP反馈生成高质量波束，显著降低波束训练开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统波束赋形需要大量波束训练开销，而用户设备反馈能力有限。需要一种方法能够从少量粗粒度反馈中生成高质量的站点特定波束。

Method: 1. 设计SIM码本最大化RSRP反馈与站点特定信道之间的互信息；2. 开发基于CFM的生成模型，将RSRP反馈作为条件先验，从后验分布中采样生成候选波束；3. 用户设备从候选波束中选择最终数据传输波束。

Result: 仅需8个探测波束和8个候选波束，就能实现接近最大比传输的性能，显著降低波束训练开销。

Conclusion: GenSSBF框架通过结合SIM码本和CFM生成模型，能够从少量粗粒度反馈中高效生成高质量波束，为大规模MIMO系统提供了一种低开销高性能的波束赋形解决方案。

Abstract: A novel generative site-specific beamforming (GenSSBF) framework is proposed, which integrates a site-information-maximizing (SIM) codebook with a conditional flow matching (CFM)-based beam generator. By this framework, the site-specific radio propagation environment is learned at the base station (BS), enabling the generation of high fidelity communication beams from coarse reference-signal-received-power (RSRP) feedback provided by user equipments (UEs). In the proposed design, a low-dimensional SIM probing codebook is first constructed by maximizing the mutual information between the RSRP feedback and the site-specific channel. This design not only reduces the initial beam sweeping overhead, but also enhances the amount of channel state information conveyed through UE feedback. By treating the RSRP feedback as a conditional prior, a CFM-based generative model is further developed to explicitly capture the uncertainty in beam generation. Specifically, a small set of UE-specific candidate beams is generated by inferring the learned generative model and sampling from the corresponding posterior distribution, after which the final data transmission beam is selected by the UE. Extensive simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of both the proposed SIM codebook and the CFM-based beam generator. The proposed GenSSBF framework achieves beamforming performance nearly identical to maximum ratio transmission while requiring only eight probing beams and eight candidate beams.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了铁路自动化背景下GNSS信号受干扰（特别是扫频干扰）对GPS L1接收机观测量的影响及检测性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着铁路自动化程度提高（如R2DATO项目），GNSS成为实现ATO、移动闭塞、虚拟耦合等关键技术。但GNSS信号易受射频干扰（RFI）威胁，包括干扰和欺骗，这对安全关键应用构成严重风险。铁路领域对此问题的关注日益增加，需要评估干扰影响并开发检测方法。

Abstract: As rail transport moves toward higher degrees of automation under initiatives like the R2DATO project [1], accurate and reliable train localization has become essential. Global Satellite Navigation System (GNSS) is considered as a main technology in enabling operational advancements including Automatic Train Operation (ATO), moving block signaling, and virtual coupling, which are the core components of the Horizon Europe 2024 rail digitalization agenda. However, GNSS signal integrity is increasingly threatened by intentional and unintentional radio frequency interference (RFI). This include jamming and spoofing, which are particularly concerning as the broadcasted signal can deliberately disrupt or manipulate the GNSS signal. - Jamming refers to an intentional form of interference that induces disturbances in the GNSS band, causing performance degradation or can even entirely block the receiver from acquiring the satellite signals. - Spoofing involves broadcasting counterfeit satellite signals to deceive the GNSS receiver, leading to inaccurate estimation of position, navigation and timing information. This concern about interference is not unique to rail applications. The aeronautical sector has long recognized the risks posed by GNSS interference, with extensive documentation on its impact on navigation, landing procedures, and surveillance systems. In recent years, awareness of these risks has expanded to other transport sectors. Within the automotive industry, particularly in Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS), several studies [2][3][4] have addressed the vulnerability of GNSS against interference. Similar concerns are now emerging in the rail domain [5][6][7], especially as GNSS is increasingly adopted in safety-critical applications. In literature, several levels of actions have been explored, ranging from merely the detection of a malicious signal at the initial phase to the application of advanced signal processing methods aimed at suppressing the effects of interference [8]. In alignment with the goal of the R2DATO project, we evaluated the impact of various classes of interference signals such as amplitude modulation (AM), frequency modulation (FM), pulsed, frequency hopping and chirp signals on the GNSS observables including Automatic Gain Control (AGC) and Carrier to Noise Ratio (CNO) as measured by a Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS). However, in this work, the analysis is only limited to impact of chirp interference on GPS L1 receiver observables and detection performance.

Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) are envisioned as a key enabler for next-generation wireless networks, offering programmable control over propagation environments. While extensive research focuses on planar RIS architectures, practical deployments often involve non-planar surfaces, such as structural columns or curved facades, where standard planar beamforming models fail. Moreover, existing analytical solutions for curved RISs are often restricted to specific, pre-defined array manifold geometries. To address this limitation, this paper proposes a novel deep learning (DL) framework for optimizing the phase shifts of non-planar RISs. We first introduce a low-dimensional parametric model to capture arbitrary surface curvature effectively. Based on this, we design a neural network (NN) that utilizes a sparse set of received power measurements to estimate the surface geometry and derive the optimal phase configuration. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm converges fast and significantly outperforms conventional planar beamforming designs, validating its robustness against arbitrary surface curvature. We also analyze the impact of the measurement location error on the algorithm's performance.

TL;DR: 本文研究了RIS辅助OTFS和OFDM系统在相位噪声下的性能，提出了一种基于维纳滤波的联合RIS信道和相位噪声估计方法，证明了RIS-OTFS在相位噪声环境下优于RIS-OFDM。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: OFDM对相位噪声敏感，可能限制RIS系统的潜在增益；OTFS对时变信道具有鲁棒性，是RIS系统的有前景波形，但相位噪声对OTFS的影响尚未充分分析，且现有文献未考虑相位噪声对RIS-OTFS系统的影响。

Conclusion: RIS-OTFS系统在相位噪声环境下优于RIS-OFDM系统，提出的联合估计方法能有效提升系统性能，为RIS辅助通信系统在相位噪声影响下的设计提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the performance of RIS-aided orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) and orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems in the presence of oscillator phase noise. OFDM is known to be sensitive to phase noise, which could limit the potential gains promised by RIS systems. OTFS, on the other hand, is a compelling potential waveform for RIS-aided systems in the presence of phase noise due to it's resilience to time-varying channels. However, the effect of phase noise on OTFS has not been fully analyzed in the literature as of yet. Additionally, no existing works in the literature consider the effect of phase noise on an RIS-aided OTFS system. Hence, we propose a joint RIS channel and phase noise estimation technique using a Wiener filtering approach. Our proposed method exploits the statistical nature of both the phase noise and the Doppler spread channel in a setup with RIS. Our numerical analysis demonstrates the significant gain of RIS-aided OTFS offers compared to RIS-aided OFDM in the presence in the presence of phase noise. Additionally, our results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed estimation technique, with gains of up to 3~dB in terms of bit error rate (BER), over existing methods in the literature.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 下一代无线网络需要精确的站点特定信道传播预测，但传统方法存在瓶颈：人工3D重建耗时数周，传统视觉重建方法缺乏射线追踪兼容性（几何缺陷、缺少材料属性）。

Abstract: Next-generation wireless networks at upper mid-band and millimeter-wave frequencies require accurate site-specific deterministic channel propagation prediction. Wireless ray tracing (RT) provides site-specific predictions but demands high-fidelity three-dimensional (3D) environment models with material properties. Manual 3D model reconstruction achieves high accuracy but requires weeks of expert effort, creating scalability bottlenecks for large environment reconstruction. Traditional vision-based 3D reconstruction methods lack RT compatibility due to geometrically defective meshes and missing material properties. This paper presents Holistic Reconstruction with Automated Material Assignment (HoRAMA) for wireless propagation prediction using NYURay. HoRAMA generates RT-compatible 3D models from RGB video readily captured using a smartphone or low-cost portable camera, by integrating MASt3R-SLAM dense point cloud generation with vision language model-assisted material assignment. The HoRAMA 3D reconstruction method is verified by comparing NYURay RT predictions, using both manually created and HoRAMA-generated 3D models, against field measurements at 6.75 GHz and 16.95 GHz across 12 TX-RX locations in a 700 square meter factory. HoRAMA ray tracing predictions achieve a 2.28 dB RMSE for matched multipath component (MPC) power predictions, comparable to the manually created 3D model baseline (2.18 dB), while reducing 3D reconstruction time from two months to 16 hours. HoRAMA enables scalable wireless digital twin creation for RT network planning, infrastructure deployment, and beam management in 5G/6G systems, as well as eventual real-time implementation at the edge.

Abstract: We investigate reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) for the task of position and velocity estimation in non-LOS (NLOS) indoor scenarios, using a snapshot based multi-step estimation algorithm. We evaluate a compound RIS structure prototype composed of four RIS tiles with 1-bit phase control per RIS unit cell. Numerical simulation results taking the antenna patterns into account are presented for an 3 m x 3 m area of interest. We demonstrate that the initial grid search step using the far field assumption is not robust enough for small distances to the RIS center and propose a more robust algorithm. Furthermore, we show that the effect of the antenna pattern causes an increased position and velocity error. Our modified three-step algorithm achieves a position error of 7 mm and a velocity error of 0.12 m/s at a distance of 2 m to the RIS center under a realistic numerical propagation model.

Abstract: Non-line-of-sight sensing of human activities in complex environments is enabled by multiple-input multiple-output through-the-wall radar (TWR). However, the distinctiveness of micro-Doppler signature between similar indoor human activities such as gun carrying and normal walking is minimal, while the large scale of input images required for effective identification utilizing time-frequency spectrograms creates challenges for model training and inference efficiency. To address this issue, the Chebyshev-time map is proposed in this paper, which is a method characterizing micro-Doppler signature using polynomial orders. The parametric kinematic models for human motion and the TWR echo model are first established. Then, a time-frequency feature representation method based on orthogonal Chebyshev polynomial decomposition is proposed. The kinematic envelopes of the torso and limbs are extracted, and the time-frequency spectrum slices are mapped into a robust Chebyshev-time coefficient space, preserving the multi-order morphological detail information of time-frequency spectrum. Numerical simulations and experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, which demonstrates the capability to characterize armed and unarmed indoor human activities while effectively compressing the scale of the time-frequency spectrum to achieve a balance between recognition accuracy and input data dimensions.

Abstract: The spherical nature of the wavefronts exhibited in the near-field of antenna arrays enables advanced beamforming capabilities, such as beampointing and beamnulling. In this paper, we exploit these properties to design a near-field beam pattern under a low exposure region constraint. We address the continuous region constraint through spatial discretization, which results in a large number of constraints that lead to prohibitive computational complexity. We propose a novel low-complexity algorithm that enables a computationally tractable beam pattern design. It uses a low-dimensional subspace representation of the low exposure region based on a singular value decomposition. Our approach achieves low complexity while providing a power received at a target user close to the optimal achievable power, yet with uniform power mitigation over the low exposure region.

Conclusion: 结论表明三维LIS近场聚焦的最优激励分布由功率约束类型决定，其行为在频率和极化方面具有不变性。共轭相位法在特定极化下能实现均匀分辨率，而时间反转法则可能产生极化相关的分辨率差异。

Abstract: This work investigates near-field focusing using a three-dimensional (3D) large intelligent surface (LIS) across frequencies and polarizations. Specifically, the LIS elements are distributed in 3D space within a long corridor, rather than being confined to a single planar aperture, and the focal point is located at a prescribed position in the radiating near field. By formulating optimization problems under both local and global power constraints, we obtain the corresponding optima. For continuous apertures, the optimal current magnitude distribution matches time-reversal (TR) solution under the global constraint and conjugate-phase (CP) solution when the local constraint dominates. When both constraints are active, the solution assigns larger excitation magnitudes to elements closer to the illumination field. This behavior remains invariant with respect to frequency and polarization for a fixed-size LIS. These findings are consistent to the more practical case of using discretized apertures in the form of Hertzian dipole arrays, studied using both analytical results and full-wave simulation. In addition, with the CP method, specific polarizations lead to identical transverse and longitudinal resolution, in contrast, under the TR method, these quantities can differ across polarizations.

Abstract: This paper proposes an efficient method for modeling and reconstructing the channel gain map (CGM) based on virtual scatterers. Specifically, we develop a virtual scatterer model to characterize the channel power gain distribution in three-dimensional (3D) space, by capturing the multi-path propagation environment structure and exploiting the angular-domain spatial correlation of scatterer response. In this model, the CGM is represented as a function over a set of tunable parameters for virtual scatterers, including their number, positions, and scatterer response coefficients (SRCs), which can be estimated from a limited number of channel power gain measurements at a given set of locations within the region of interest. This new representation offers a flexible and scalable modeling framework for efficient and accurate CGM reconstruction. Furthermore, we propose a progressive estimation algorithm to acquire the scatterers' parameters. In this algorithm, we gradually increase the number of virtual scatterers to balance the computational complexity and estimation accuracy. In addition, by exploiting the spatial correlation of scatterer response, we propose a Gaussian process regression (GPR)-based inference method to predict the SRCs that cannot be directly estimated. Finally, ray-tracing-based simulation results under realistic physical environments validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, demonstrating that it achieves higher reconstruction accuracy compared to conventional CGM estimation approaches.

Abstract: Due to great efficiency improvement in resource and hardware space, integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) has gained much attention. In the paper, the physical layer security (PLS) of ISAC system under communication eavesdropper together with sensing eavesdropper is investigated. The system secrecy rate is maximized by transmit beamforming design of communication and sensing signals when taking sensing security, sensing performance and transmit power constraint into consideration. To deal with the formulated non-convex optimization problem, the successive convex approximation (SCA) together with the first-order Taylor expansion and semidefinite relaxation (SDR) is utilized. Additionally, it is theoretically validated that the SDR does not yield sub-optimality in the paper. Thereafter, an iterated joint secure beamforming algorithm against communication and sensing eavesdroppers is proposed. Simulation results validate the effectiveness and advance of the proposed scheme.

Abstract: This paper investigates a multiple-input multipleoutput (MIMO) visible light communication (VLC) wiretap channel consisting of a transmitter, a legitimate receiver, and an eavesdropper. The optical input is subject to both peakand average-intensity constraints. By applying the generalized entropy-power inequality to truncated exponential inputs, we derive a novel closed-form expression for the achievable secrecy rate for general MIMO VLC configurations. To enhance transmission confidentiality, a fully-connected beamforming scheme is proposed, along with a low-complexity sub-connected alternative. Although the resulting beamforming design problems are nonconvex, they are efficiently addressed by transforming them into a sequence of convex subproblems solvable via the successive convex approximation framework. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed schemes achieve significant secrecy performance improvements compared with the benchmark scheme.

*Zhe Zhai,Sheng Jin,Qifu Tyler Sun,Zongpeng Li*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 基于循环移位操作构造了在有限域Fq上实现的最大秩距离(MRD)码，避免了传统构造中需要Fq^N算术的复杂性，降低了计算复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MRD码构造依赖于Fq^N的算术运算，随着N增大计算复杂度急剧增加，这限制了参数选择和实际应用。需要一种更高效的构造方法。

Method: 基于循环移位操作，利用欧拉函数J和满足gcd(q,L)=1的L参数，在Fq上直接构造(J×n, q^{Jk}, d) MRD码，避免了Fq^J的算术运算。

Result: 当J≠mL时，构造的MRD码与任何Gabidulin码和twisted Gabidulin码都不同；当J=mL时，与Gabidulin码等价。在q=2、L为素数、n≤mL时，编码复杂度从O(nkL^2)降低到O(nkL)。

Conclusion: 提出的基于循环移位的MRD码构造方法在Fq上实现，计算复杂度显著低于传统方法，为实际应用提供了更高效的编码方案。

Abstract: Most well-known constructions of $(N \times n, q^{Nk}, d)$ maximum rank distance (MRD) codes rely on the arithmetic of $\mathbb{F}_{q^N}$, whose increasing complexity with larger $N$ hinders parameter selection and practical implementation. In this work, based on circular-shift operations, we present a construction of $(J \times n, q^{Jk}, d)$ MRD codes with efficient encoding, where $J$ equals to the Euler's totient function of a defined $L$ subject to $\gcd(q, L) = 1$. The proposed construction is performed entirely over $\mathbb{F}_q$ and avoids the arithmetic of $\mathbb{F}_{q^J}$. We further characterize the constructed MRD codes, Gabidulin codes and twisted Gabidulin codes using a set of $q$-linearized polynomials over the row vector space $\mathbb{F}_{q}^N$, and clarify their inherent difference and connection. For the case $J \neq m_L$, where $m_L$ denotes the multiplicative order of $q$ modulo $L$, we show that the proposed MRD codes, in a family of settings, are different from any Gabidulin code and any twisted Gabidulin code. For the case $J = m_L$, we prove that every constructed $(J \times n, q^{Jk}, d)$ MRD code coincides with a $(J \times n, q^{Jk}, d)$ Gabidulin code, yielding an equivalent circular-shift-based construction that operates directly over $\mathbb{F}_q$. In addition, we prove that under some parameter settings, the constructed MRD codes are equivalent to a generalization of Gabidulin codes obtained by summing and concatenating several $(m_L \times n, q^{m_Lk}, d)$ Gabidulin codes. When $q=2$, $L$ is prime and $n\leq m_L$, it is analyzed that generating a codeword of the proposed $((L-1) \times n, 2^{(L-1)k}, d)$ MRD codes requires $O(nkL)$ exclusive OR (XOR) operations, while generating a codeword of $((L-1) \times n, 2^{(L-1)k}, d)$ Gabidulin codes, based on customary construction, requires $O(nkL^2)$ XOR operations.

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: FPNet：一个统一的深度学习框架，利用波束赋形反馈矩阵进行Wi-Fi室内定位，同时实现信道反馈压缩、精确定位和异常检测，在商用设备上达到97%定位精度和99%异常检测准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Wi-Fi室内定位面临两个主要问题：1）完整信道状态信息(CSI)在实际部署中难以获取，硬件限制和通信开销大；2）现有定位模型缺乏检测用户是否超出训练区域的机制，导致动态环境中估计不可靠。

Method: FPNet采用统一深度学习框架，利用IEEE 802.11ac/ax/be协议原生支持的波束赋形反馈矩阵(BFM)作为压缩CSI表示，减少反馈开销。框架包含ADBlock轻量级异常检测模块，基于正常BFM样本训练，用于识别用户离开预定义空间区域的异常情况。

Result: 使用标准2.4 GHz Wi-Fi硬件实验显示：FPNet仅用100反馈比特即可实现97%以上的定位精度；网络吞吐量提升最高达22.92%；异常检测准确率超过99%，误报率低于1.5%。

Conclusion: FPNet能够在商用Wi-Fi设备上实现高效、准确且可靠的室内定位，通过统一框架同时解决了信道反馈压缩、精确定位和异常检测三个关键问题。

Abstract: Channel State Information (CSI) provides a detailed description of the wireless channel and has been widely adopted for Wi-Fi sensing, particularly for high-precision indoor positioning. However, complete CSI is rarely available in real-world deployments due to hardware constraints and the high communication overhead required for feedback. Moreover, existing positioning models lack mechanisms to detect when users move outside their trained regions, leading to unreliable estimates in dynamic environments. In this paper, we present FPNet, a unified deep learning framework that jointly addresses channel feedback compression, accurate indoor positioning, and robust anomaly detection (AD). FPNet leverages the beamforming feedback matrix (BFM), a compressed CSI representation natively supported by IEEE 802.11ac/ax/be protocols, to minimize feedback overhead while preserving critical positioning features. To enhance reliability, we integrate ADBlock, a lightweight AD module trained on normal BFM samples, which identifies out-of-distribution scenarios when users exit predefined spatial regions. Experimental results using standard 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi hardware show that FPNet achieves positioning accuracy above 97% with only 100 feedback bits, boosts net throughput by up to 22.92%, and attains AD accuracy over 99% with a false alarm rate below 1.5%. These results demonstrate FPNet's ability to deliver efficient, accurate, and reliable indoor positioning on commodity Wi-Fi devices.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DNA存储系统面临测序噪声和随机采样的挑战，需要设计能够同时处理这两种噪声的编码方案，以最大化可靠存储的信息量。

Method: 采用级联编码方案：外码处理随机采样，内码处理测序噪声。内码使用线性分组码和零未检测错误解码器，假设测序信道对称，推导出最大似然解码器的可达界。

Conclusion: 提出的级联编码方案能有效处理DNA存储中的测序噪声和采样问题，推导的可达界为DNA存储系统的设计提供了理论指导，零未检测错误容量下界的结果具有独立意义。

Abstract: We study the amount of reliable information that can be stored in a DNA-based storage system with noisy sequencing, where each codeword is composed of short DNA molecules. We analyze a concatenated coding scheme, where the outer code is designed to handle the random sampling, while the inner code is designed to handle the random sequencing noise. We assume that the sequencing channel is symmetric and choose the inner coding scheme to be composed by a linear block code and a zero-undetected-error decoder. As a byproduct, the resulting optimal maximum-likelihood decoder land itself for an amenable analysis, and we are able to derive an achievability bound for the scaling of the number of information bits that can be reliably stored. As a result of independent interest, we prove that the average error probability of random linear block codes under zero-undetected-error decoding converges to zero exponentially fast with the block length, as long as its coding rate does not exceed some critical value, which is known to serve as a lower bound to the zero-undetected-error capacity.

TL;DR: EARL：基于强化学习的能量感知自适应天线控制框架，用于降低无小区大规模MIMO系统的功耗


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无小区大规模MIMO系统虽然能提供均匀的高性能，但由于分布式射频单元联合传输和云端集中处理，带来了高能耗问题。需要一种能在满足用户频谱效率需求的同时，降低系统功耗的解决方案。

Method: 利用O-RAN的资源共享能力，提出基于强化学习的EARL框架，动态配置射频单元中的天线元件，以最小化射频、光前传和云端处理的功耗。

Result: 相比全开和启发式基线，分别实现了高达81%和50%的节能效果。RL方法在220ms内运行，满足O-RAN近实时限制，贪婪优化进一步在2秒运行时间内将功耗减半。

Conclusion: EARL框架有效解决了无小区大规模MIMO系统的能耗问题，在满足性能需求的同时显著降低功耗，且符合O-RAN的时间约束，具有实际部署可行性。

Abstract: Cell-free massive multi-input multi-output (MIMO) promises uniform high performance across the network, but also brings a high energy cost due to joint transmission from distributed radio units (RUs) and centralized processing in the cloud. Leveraging the resource-sharing capabilities of Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN), we propose EARL, an energy-aware adaptive antenna control framework based on reinforcement learning. EARL dynamically configures antenna elements in RUs to minimize radio, optical fronthaul, and cloud processing power consumption while meeting user spectral efficiency demands. Numerical results show power savings of up to 81% and 50% over full-on and heuristic baselines, respectively. The RL-based approach operates within 220 ms, satisfying O-RAN's near-real-time limit, and a greedy refinement further halves power consumption at a 2 s runtime.

Conclusion: 需要重新思考TOSC的基本极限，考虑实际任务模型约束，发送端复杂度是当前系统的主要瓶颈，未来工作应关注更现实的界限和优化策略。

Abstract: Task-Oriented Source Coding (TOSC) has emerged as a paradigm for efficient visual data communication in machine-centric inference systems, where bitrate, latency, and task performance must be jointly optimized under resource constraints. While recent works have proposed rate-distortion bounds for coding for machines, these results often rely on strong assumptions on task identifiability and neglect the impact of deployed task models. In this work, we revisit the fundamental limits of single-TOSC through the lens of indirect rate-distortion theory. We highlight the conditions under which existing rate-distortion bounds are achievable and show their limitations in realistic settings. We then introduce task model-aware rate-distortion bounds that account for task model suboptimality and architectural constraints. Experiments on standard classification benchmarks confirm that current learned TOSC schemes operate far from these limits, highlighting transmitter-side complexity as a key bottleneck.
