Conclusion: 提出的迁移学习方法能有效解决领域差异问题，提升波束预测在目标域的性能

Abstract: Existing transfer learning-based beam prediction approaches primarily rely on
simple fine-tuning. When there is a significant difference in data distribution
between the target domain and the source domain, simple fine-tuning limits the
model's performance in the target domain. To tackle this problem, we propose a
transfer learning-based beam prediction method that combines fine-tuning with
domain adaptation. We integrate a domain classifier into fine-tuning the
pre-trained model. The model extracts domain-invariant features in adversarial
training with domain classifier, which can enhance model performance in the
target domain. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed transfer
learning-based beam prediction method achieves better achievable rate
performance than the pure fine-tuning method in the target domain, and close to
those when the training is done from scratch on the target domain.

### [2] [On Theoretical Interpretations of Concept-Based In-Context Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20882)
*Huaze Tang,Tianren Peng,Shao-lun Huang*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 本文提出概念式上下文学习（CB-ICL）的理论分析框架，解释其在少量示例下预测查询标签的机制，量化LLM可利用的知识，并提出相似性度量方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 上下文学习（ICL）已成为NLP和LLM应用的重要范式，但其理论机制理解有限，需要深入研究ICL的工作原理。

Method: 提出概念式ICL（CB-ICL）的理论分析框架，通过数学建模分析ICL任务中的预测机制，量化知识转移过程，并探索提示示例数量和嵌入维度的影响。

Result: 理论分析解释了CB-ICL在少量示例下表现良好的原因，提出了相似性度量方法，并通过真实数据实验验证了CB-ICL及其理论的实用性。

Conclusion: 该研究为ICL提供了理论支撑，对模型预训练和提示工程具有重要指导意义，深化了对LLM上下文学习机制的理解。

Abstract: In-Context Learning (ICL) has emerged as an important new paradigm in natural
language processing and large language model (LLM) applications. However, the
theoretical understanding of the ICL mechanism remains limited. This paper aims
to investigate this issue by studying a particular ICL approach, called
concept-based ICL (CB-ICL). In particular, we propose theoretical analyses on
applying CB-ICL to ICL tasks, which explains why and when the CB-ICL performs
well for predicting query labels in prompts with only a few demonstrations. In
addition, the proposed theory quantifies the knowledge that can be leveraged by
the LLMs to the prompt tasks, and leads to a similarity measure between the
prompt demonstrations and the query input, which provides important insights
and guidance for model pre-training and prompt engineering in ICL. Moreover,
the impact of the prompt demonstration size and the dimension of the LLM
embeddings in ICL are also explored based on the proposed theory. Finally,
several real-data experiments are conducted to validate the practical
usefulness of CB-ICL and the corresponding theory.

### [3] [Optimal Repair of $(k+2, k, 2)$ MDS Array Codes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21036)
*Zihao Zhang,Guodong Li,Sihuang Hu*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 该论文针对具有两个校验节点和子分组大小为2的MDS码，推导了最小修复带宽和最小I/O开销的紧下界，并提出了达到这些界限的显式构造。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MSR码通常需要指数级大的子分组级别，导致显著的磁盘I/O开销。虽然已有研究探索了子分组级别与修复带宽之间的权衡，但对于固定子分组大小的MDS码单节点故障的最小修复带宽这一基本问题仍未解决。

Method: 针对n-k=2且ℓ=2的情况，推导了最小修复带宽和最小I/O开销的紧下界，并提出了两个达到这些界限的显式MDS阵列码构造。

Result: 获得了针对两个校验节点和子分组大小为2的MDS码的最小修复带宽和最小I/O开销的紧下界，并提供了达到这些界限的实际代码设计。

Conclusion: 该研究解决了固定子分组大小下MDS码修复效率的基本问题，为分布式存储系统提供了具有可证明修复效率的实用代码设计方案。

Abstract: Maximum distance separable (MDS) codes are widely used in distributed storage
systems as they provide optimal fault tolerance for a given amount of storage
overhead.
  The seminal work of Dimakis~\emph{et al.} first established a lower bound on
the repair bandwidth for a single failed node of MDS codes, known as the
\emph{cut-set bound}. MDS codes that achieve this bound are called minimum
storage regenerating (MSR) codes. Numerous constructions and theoretical
analyses of MSR codes reveal that they typically require exponentially large
sub-packetization levels, leading to significant disk I/O overhead. To mitigate
this issue, many studies explore the trade-offs between the sub-packetization
level and repair bandwidth, achieving reduced sub-packetization at the cost of
suboptimal repair bandwidth. Despite these advances, the fundamental question
of determining the minimum repair bandwidth for a single failure of MDS codes
with fixed sub-packetization remains open.
  In this paper, we address this challenge for the case of two parity nodes
($n-k=2$) and sub-packetization $\ell=2$. We derive tight lower bounds on both
the minimum repair bandwidth and the minimum I/O overhead. Furthermore, we
present two explicit MDS array code constructions that achieve these bounds,
respectively, offering practical code designs with provable repair efficiency.

### [4] [Task-Oriented Computation Offloading for Edge Inference: An Integrated Bayesian Optimization and Deep Reinforcement Learning Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21090)
*Xian Li,Suzhi Bi,Ying-Jun Angela Zhang*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: LAB框架通过结合深度强化学习和贝叶斯优化，解决边缘智能中数据传输精度与延迟的权衡问题，实现近最优的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 边缘设备在传输高容量AI任务数据时面临带宽限制导致的显著延迟，而数据降级虽然减少延迟但会降低推理精度，需要平衡这一关键权衡。

Method: 提出LAB学习框架，集成深度强化学习（DRL）和贝叶斯优化（BO）：使用DNN actor处理组合复杂性，BO critic构建高斯过程代理模型评估动作，并通过凸优化进行带宽分配。

Result: 在真实自动驾驶数据集上的数值评估显示，LAB实现了近最优的精度-延迟权衡，相比穷举搜索仅产生1.22%的精度下降和0.07秒的额外延迟。

Conclusion: LAB框架有效解决了边缘智能中的黑盒混合整数非线性规划问题，为精度与延迟的权衡提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Edge intelligence (EI) allows resource-constrained edge devices (EDs) to
offload computation-intensive AI tasks (e.g., visual object detection) to edge
servers (ESs) for fast execution. However, transmitting high-volume raw task
data (e.g., 4K video) over bandwidth-limited wireless networks incurs
significant latency. While EDs can reduce transmission latency by degrading
data before transmission (e.g., reducing resolution from 4K to 720p or 480p),
it often deteriorates inference accuracy, creating a critical accuracy-latency
tradeoff. The difficulty in balancing this tradeoff stems from the absence of
closed-form models capturing content-dependent accuracy-latency relationships.
Besides, under bandwidth sharing constraints, the discrete degradation
decisions among the EDs demonstrate inherent combinatorial complexity.
Mathematically, it requires solving a challenging \textit{black-box}
mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP). To address this problem, we
propose LAB, a novel learning framework that seamlessly integrates deep
reinforcement learning (DRL) and Bayesian optimization (BO). Specifically, LAB
employs: (a) a DNN-based actor that maps input system state to degradation
actions, directly addressing the combinatorial complexity of the MINLP; and (b)
a BO-based critic with an explicit model built from fitting a Gaussian process
surrogate with historical observations, enabling model-based evaluation of
degradation actions. For each selected action, optimal bandwidth allocation is
then efficiently derived via convex optimization. Numerical evaluations on
real-world self-driving datasets demonstrate that LAB achieves near-optimal
accuracy-latency tradeoff, exhibiting only 1.22\% accuracy degradation and
0.07s added latency compared to exhaustive search...

### [5] [UAV-Enabled ISAC Systems with Fluid Antennas](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21105)

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled integrated sensing and communication
(ISAC) is regarded as a key enabler for next-generation wireless systems.
However, conventional fixed antenna arrays limit the ability of UAVs to fully
exploit their inherent potential. To overcome this limitation, we propose a
UAV-enabled ISAC framework equipped with fluid antenna (FA) arrays, where the
mobility of antenna elements introduces additional spatial degrees of freedom
to simultaneously enhance communication and sensing performance. A
multi-objective optimization problem is formulated to maximize the
communication rates of multiple users while minimizing the Cram\'er-Rao bound
(CRB) for single-target angle estimation. Due to excessively frequent updates
of FA positions may lead to response delays, a three-timescale optimization
framework is developed to jointly design transmit beamforming, FA positions,
and UAV trajectory based on their characteristics. To solve the non-convexity
of the problem, an alternating optimization-based algorithm is developed to
obtain a sub-optimal solution. Numerical results show that the proposed scheme
significantly outperforms various benchmark schemes, validating the
effectiveness of integrating the FA technology into the UAV-enabled ISAC
systems.

Conclusion: RMC-SC码提供了一种有效的自适应编码解决方案，能够满足不同系统需求并优化性能。

Abstract: Spatially-coupled (SC) codes are a class of low-density parity-check (LDPC)
codes that have excellent performance thanks to the degrees of freedom they
offer. An SC code is designed by partitioning a base matrix into components,
the number of which implies the code memory, then coupling and lifting them. In
the same system, various error-correction coding schemes are typically needed.
For example, in wireless communication standards, several channel conditions
and data rates should be supported. In storage and computing systems, stronger
codes should be adopted as the device ages. Adaptive code design enables
switching from one code to another when needed, ensuring reliability while
reducing hardware cost. In this paper, we introduce a class of reconfigurable
SC codes named rate-memory-compatible SC (RMC-SC) codes, which we design
probabilistically. In particular, rate compatibility in RMC-SC codes is
achieved via increasing the SC code memory, which also makes the codes
memory-compatible and improves performance. We express the expected number of
short cycles in the SC code protograph as a function of the fixed probability
distribution characterizing the already-designed SC code as well as the unknown
distribution characterizing the additional components. We use the
gradient-descent algorithm to find a locally-optimal distribution, in terms of
cycle count, for the new components. The method can be recursively used to
design any number of SC codes needed, and we show how to extend it to other
cases. Next, we perform the finite-length optimization using a Markov chain
Monte Carlo (MC$^2$) approach that we update to design the proposed RMC-SC
codes. Experimental results demonstrate significant reductions in cycle counts
and remarkable performance gains achieved by RMC-SC codes compared with a
literature-based straightforward scheme.

### [7] [Path-Controlled Secure Network Coding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21115)
*Masahide Sasaki,Te Sun Han,Mikio Fujiwara,Kai Li,Oliver Hambrey,Atsushi Esumi*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为PUSNEC的新方法，通过多树组播路径查找与通用强斜坡安全网络编码相结合，解决现有安全组播技术在可扩展性、组播容量和信息论安全性方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于重复转发路由和计算安全性的组播方法无法达到网络组播容量，也无法保证长期安全性。现有的信息论安全解决方案（如QKD、PLS、SNC）在可扩展性方面存在局限，随着网络规模扩大，其假设条件逐渐失效。

Method: 开发了高效的多树组播路径查找方法，并与通用强斜坡安全网络编码集成，形成路径控制的通用强斜坡安全网络编码系统（PUSNEC），可叠加在QKD/PLS网络上。

Result: 在概率窃听网络假设下推导了最大信息泄露量，通过数值模拟展示了多跳网络中的安全组播，定量分析了保密性与可靠性的权衡关系。

Conclusion: PUSNEC为实现全球范围内安全可靠的组播提供了一种实用方法，能够同时实现组播容量、信息论安全性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Multicast for securely sharing confidential data among many users is becoming
increasingly important. Currently, it relies on duplicate-and-forward routing
and cryptographic methods based on computational security. However, these
approaches neither attain multicast capacity of the network, nor ensure
long-term security against advances in computing (information-theoretic
security: ITS). Existing ITS solutions--quantum key distribution (QKD),
physical layer security (PLS), and secure network coding (SNC)--still fail to
enable scalable networks, as their underlying assumptions, such as trusted
nodes and wiretap thresholds, gradually become invalid as the network grows.
Here, we develop an efficient multi-tree multicast path-finding method to
address this issue, integrating it with universal strongly ramp SNC. This
system, path-controlled universal strongly ramp SNC (PUSNEC), can be overlaid
onto QKD/PLS networks, enabling multicast capacity, ITS, and scalability. We
derive the maximum leakage information to an eavesdropper under the
probabilistic wiretap network assumption and demonstrate secure multicast in
multi-hop networks through numerical simulations. Our quantitative analysis of
the secrecyreliability tradeoff highlights a practical approach to achieving
secure, reliable multicast on a global scale.

### [8] [A Converse For the Capacity of the Shotgun Sequencing Channel with Erasures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21216)
*Mohammed Ihsan Ali,Hrishi Narayanan,Prasad Krishnan*

Conclusion: 本文为带有擦除的霰弹枪测序信道建立了逆定理，填补了该领域的研究空白。

Abstract: The shotgun sequencing process involves fragmenting a long DNA sequence
(input string) into numerous shorter, unordered, and overlapping segments
(referred to as \emph{reads}). The reads are sequenced, and later aligned to
reconstruct the original string. Viewing the sequencing process as the
read-phase of a DNA storage system, the information-theoretic capacity of
noise-free shotgun sequencing has been characterized in literature. Motivated
by the base-wise quality scores available in practical sequencers, a recent
work considered the \emph{shotgun sequencing channel with erasures}, in which
the symbols in the reads are assumed to contain random erasures. Achievable
rates for this channel were identified. In the present work, we obtain a
converse for this channel. The arguments for the proof involve a careful
analysis of a genie-aided decoder, which knows the correct locations of the
reads. The converse is not tight in general. However, it meets the
achievability result asymptotically in some channel parameters.

### [9] [Fundamental Limits of Noncoherent Massive Random Access Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21300)
*Grace Villacrés,Tobias Koch,Gonzalo Vazquez-Vilar*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 本文研究了大规模随机接入蜂窝网络的容量，分析了干扰受限网络中容量的功率依赖性，发现干扰衰减速率是决定容量是否受功率限制的关键因素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大规模随机接入蜂窝网络的容量极限，特别关注干扰对网络容量的影响，验证Lozano等人观察到的干扰受限网络饱和现象是否可以通过随机用户活动或非尺度族信道输入来避免。

Method: 采用MIMO衰落信道模型，假设无限个干扰小区，使用随机编码论证和相同分布码本假设，推导出容量的严格界限，分析不同路径损耗条件下的容量行为。

Result: 发现当干扰衰落系数按指数或更慢速率衰减时，容量受发射功率限制；当衰减快于双指数时，容量不受功率限制。使用突发信号传输和将干扰视为噪声的方法证明了无界容量的存在。

Conclusion: 干扰衰减速率是决定网络容量是否受功率限制的关键因素，干扰受限网络的饱和现象无法通过随机用户活动或非尺度族输入来避免，但在快速衰减干扰条件下可以实现无界容量。

Abstract: This paper studies the capacity of massive random-access cellular networks,
modeled as a MIMO fading channel with an infinite number of interfering cells.
To characterize the symmetric sum rate of the network, a random-coding argument
is invoked together with the assumption that in all cells users draw their
codebooks according to the same distribution. This can be viewed as a
generalization of the assumption of Gaussian codebooks, often encountered in
the literature. The network is further assumed to be noncoherent: the
transmitters and receivers are cognizant of the statistics of the fading
coefficients, but are ignorant of their realizations. Finally, it is assumed
that the users access the network at random. For the considered channel model,
rigorous bounds on the capacity are derived. The behavior of these bounds
depends critically on the path loss from signals transmitted in interfering
cells to the intended cell. In particular, if the fading coefficients of the
interferers (ordered according to their distance to the receiver) decay
exponentially or more slowly, then the capacity is bounded in the transmit
power. This confirms that the saturation regime in interference-limited
networks -- observed by Lozano, Heath, and Andrews ("Fundamental limits of
cooperation", IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory, Sept. 2013) -- cannot be avoided by
random user activity or by using channel inputs beyond the scale family. In
contrast, if the fading coefficients decay faster than double-exponentially,
then the capacity is unbounded in the transmit power. Proving an unbounded
capacity is nontrivial even if the number of interfering cells is finite, since
the condition that the users' codebooks follow the same distribution prevents
interference-avoiding strategies such as time- or frequency-division multiple
access. We obtain this result by using bursty signaling together with treating
interference as noise.

Conclusion: 该方法首次实现了非顺序马尔可夫建模，显著提高了SP-LiDAR时间戳分布分析的效率和准确性，为高精度3D应用和导航提供了重要工具。

Abstract: Asynchronous single-photon LiDAR (SP-LiDAR) is an important imaging modality
for high-quality 3D applications and navigation, but the modeling of the
timestamp distributions of a SP-LiDAR in the presence of dead time remains a
very challenging open problem. Prior works have shown that timestamps form a
discrete-time Markov chain, whose stationary distribution can be computed as
the leading left eigenvector of a large transition matrix. However,
constructing this matrix is known to be computationally expensive because of
the coupling between states and the dead time. This paper presents the first
non-sequential Markov modeling for the timestamp distribution. The key
innovation is an equivalent formulation that reparameterizes the integral
bounds and separates the effect of dead time as a deterministic row permutation
of a base matrix. This decoupling enables efficient vectorized matrix
construction, yielding up to $1000 \times$ acceleration over existing methods.
The new model produces a nearly exact stationary distribution when compared
with the gold standard Monte Carlo simulations, yet using a fraction of the
time. In addition, a new theoretical analysis reveals the impact of the
magnitude and phase of the second-largest eigenvalue, which are overlooked in
the literature but are critical to the convergence.

Conclusion: 离散夹持天线辅助无线供电MEC系统能够有效提升性能，天线激活的灵活性对多址接入方案的选择有重要影响。在精细控制条件下，TDMA方案展现出更好的计算性能优势。

Abstract: Pinching antennas (PAs), a new type of reconfigurable and flexible antenna
structures, have recently attracted significant research interest due to their
ability to create line-of-sight links and mitigate large-scale path loss. Owing
to their potential benefits, integrating PAs into wireless powered mobile edge
computing (MEC) systems is regarded as a viable solution to enhance both energy
transfer and task offloading efficiency. Unlike prior studies that assume ideal
continuous PA placement along waveguides, this paper investigates a practical
discrete PA-assisted wireless powered MEC framework, where devices first
harvest energy from PA-emitted radio-frequency signals and then adopt a partial
offloading mode, allocating part of the harvested energy to local computing and
the remainder to uplink offloading. The uplink phase considers both the
time-division multiple access (TDMA) and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA),
each examined under three levels of PA activation flexibility. For each
configuration, we formulate a joint optimization problem to maximize the total
computational bits and conduct a theoretical performance comparison between the
TDMA and NOMA schemes. To address the resulting mixed-integer nonlinear
problems, we develop a two-layer algorithm that combines closed-form solutions
based on Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions with a cross-entropy-based
learning method. Numerical results validate the superiority of the proposed
design in terms of the harvested energy and computation performance, revealing
that TDMA and NOMA achieve comparable performance under coarser PA activation
levels, whereas finer activation granularity enables TDMA to achieve superior
computation performance over NOMA.

### [12] [A General Optimization Framework for Movable Antenna Systems via Discrete Sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20987)

Conclusion: 该框架为移动天线位置优化提供了一种有效且低复杂度的解决方案，能够避免局部最优并实现优异的通信性能。

Abstract: Movable antenna (MA) systems have attracted growing interest in wireless
communications due to their ability to reshape wireless channels via local
antenna movement within a confined region. However, optimizing antenna
positions to enhance communication performance turns out to be challenging due
to the highly nonlinear relationship between wireless channels and antenna
positions. Existing approaches, such as gradient-based and heuristic
algorithms, often suffer from high computational complexity or undesired local
optima. To address the above challenge, this letter proposes a general and
low-complexity optimization framework for MA position optimization.
Specifically, we discretize the antenna movement region into a set of sampling
points, thereby transforming the continuous optimization problem into a
discrete point selection problem. Next, we sequentially update the optimal
sampling point for each MA over multiple rounds. To avoid convergence to poor
local optima, a Gibbs sampling (GS) phase is introduced between rounds to
explore adjacent and randomly generated candidate solutions. As a case study,
we investigate joint precoding and antenna position optimization for an
MA-enhanced broadcast system by applying the proposed framework. Numerical
results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves near-optimal
performance and significantly outperforms existing benchmarks.

Motivation: 触觉互联网需要超低延迟和可靠的触觉信号传输，但数据包丢失和延迟问题仍未解决

Method: 集成高斯过程与基于ResNet的神经网络，使用高斯过程作为预言机来恢复丢失或严重延迟的信号，并引入Shapley特征值进行特征选择

Result: GP+SFV框架达到95.72%的准确率，比现有最佳方法LeFo提升11.1%，同时放宽了触觉互联网的严格延迟约束；SFV作为模块化加速器，与LeFo结合减少27%推理时间，与GP结合减少72%推理时间

Conclusion: GP+SFV既是高精度又是高效率的解决方案，为触觉互联网中实用可靠的触觉通信铺平了道路

Abstract: The Tactile Internet (TI) requires ultra-low latency and reliable haptic
signal transmission, yet packet loss and delay remain unresolved challenges. We
present a novel prediction framework that integrates Gaussian Processes (GP)
with a ResNet-based Neural Network, where GP acts as an oracle to recover
signals lost or heavily delayed. To further optimize performance, we introduce
Shapley Feature Values (SFV), a principled feature selection mechanism that
isolates the most informative inputs for prediction. This GP+SFV framework
achieves 95.72% accuracy, surpassing the state-of-the-art LeFo method by 11.1%,
while simultaneously relaxing TI's rigid delay constraints. Beyond accuracy,
SFV operates as a modular accelerator: when paired with LeFo, it reduces
inference time by 27%, and when paired with GP, by 72%. These results establish
GP+SFV as both a high-accuracy and high-efficiency solution, paving the way for

Abstract: The ongoing convergence of spectrum and hardware requirements for wireless
sensing and communication applications has fueled the integrated sensing and
communication (ISAC) paradigm in next-generation networks. Neural-network-based
ISAC leverages data-driven learning techniques to add sensing capabilities to
existing communication infrastructure. This paper presents a novel
signal-processing framework for such neural ISAC systems based on the
multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) and orthogonal frequency-division
multiplexing (OFDM) downlink. Our approach enables generalized sensing
functionality without modifying the MIMO-OFDM communication link. Specifically,
our neural ISAC pipeline measures the backscattered communication signals to
generate discrete map representations of spatial occupancy, formulated as
multiclass or multilabel classification problems, which can then be utilized by
specialized downstream tasks. To improve sensing performance in closed or
cluttered environments, our neural ISAC pipeline relies on features
specifically designed to mitigate strong reflective paths. Extensive
simulations using ray-tracing models demonstrate that our neural ISAC framework
reliably reconstructs scene maps without altering the MIMO-OFDM communication
pipeline or reducing data rates.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel framework for enhancing the security, data rate,
and sensing performance of integrated sensing and communications (ISAC)
systems. We employ a random frequency and pulse repetition interval (PRI)
agility (RFPA) method for the waveform design, where the necessary random
sequences are governed by shared secrets. These secrets, which can be
pre-shared or generated via channel reciprocity, obfuscate critical radar
parameters like Doppler frequency and pulse start times, thereby significantly
impeding the ability to perform reconnaissance from a passive adversary without
the secret key. To further introduce enhanced data throughput, we also
introduce a hybrid information embedding scheme that integrates amplitude shift
keying (ASK), phase shift keying (PSK), index modulation (IM), and spatial
modulation (SM), for which a low-complexity sparse-matched filter receiver is
proposed for accurate decoding with practical complexity. Finally, the
excellent range-velocity resolution and clutter suppression of the proposed
waveform are analyzed via the ambiguity function (AF).

Abstract: We propose an adversarially robust physical layer authentication (AR-PLA)
framework tailored for non-stationary multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)
wireless channels. The framework integrates sequential Bayesian
decision-making, deep feature extraction via contrastive learning, and
generative adversarial modeling to simulate adaptive spoofers. Unlike
conventional methods that assume stationary channels or independent
observations, our approach explicitly accounts for temporal and spatial
correlations, line-of-sight (LoS) blockages, and dynamic spoofing strategies. A
comprehensive analytical characterization of the authentication performance
using both 2-state and 3-state hidden Markov models (HMMs) with moving-average
online adaptation is also provided, with closed-form recursions for
loglikelihood ratios, detection probabilities, and steady-state approximations,
which demonstrate significant robustness improvement over classical sequential
authentication schemes.

Abstract: Bearings are among the most failure-prone components in rotating machinery,
and their condition directly impacts overall performance. Therefore, accurately
diagnosing bearing faults is essential for ensuring system stability. However,
detecting such malfunctions in noisy environments, where data is collected from
multiple sensors, necessitates the extraction and selection of informative
features. This paper proposes an improved distance evaluation algorithm
combined with a weighted K-nearest neighbor (KNN) classifier for bearing fault
diagnosis. The process begins with extracting and integrating statistical
features of vibration across the time, frequency, and time-frequency domains.
Next, the improved distance evaluation algorithm assigns weights to the
extracted features, retaining only the most informative ones by eliminating
insensitive features. Finally, the selected features are used to train the
weighted KNN classifier. To validate the proposed method, we employ bearing
data from the University of Ottawa. The results demonstrate the effectiveness
of our approach in accurately identifying bearing faults.

Abstract: The escalating development of oceanic applications like underwater
surveillance and mineral exploration, is motivating real-time wireless backhaul
of the considerable observation data. Such prospects can be hardly realized by
the narrowband acoustic approach. Alternatively, optical wireless communication
(OWC) has emerged as a promising solution for maritime and underwater
applications due to its great potential for broadband underwater transmission.
However, the implementations of water-air OWC can be rather challenging,
especially when penetrating the fluctuating interface, where the direction of
refracted signals changes dynamically, causing severe beam misalignment with
airborne stations. This has necessitated real-time transceiver alignment
adaptable to the sophisticated oceanic environment, which has yet to be
addressed. Against this background, this paper establishes a mathematical
channel model for water-air optical wireless transmission across the
fluctuating sea surface. Based on the model, we propose a vision-based beam
tracking algorithm that leverages artificial intelligence (AI) methods for
dynamic channel prediction. The proposed algorithm integrates a convolutional
neural network (CNN) with bi-directional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM),
which further incorporates the attention mechanism to effectively extract
critical spatio-temporal features from the vision data. The numerical
simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can outperform its
classical counterparts in maintaining receiving signal strength and supressing
the vision noises, which demonstrates its robustness against the the harsh
conditions of water-air OWC systems.

Abstract: Accurate characterization of sensor output uncertainty is important for
reliable data interpretation in many applications. Here, we investigate the
impact of transducer-level measurement uncertainty on overall sensor
measurement accuracy due to limited-precision information about sensor
components. We explain our method using thermopile-based sensors as an example
class of sensors. We show how sensor calibration and conversion equations,
which are an essential part of all sensing systems, propagate uncertainties
resulting from the quantization of calibration parameters, to the final,
compensated sensor output. The experimental results show that the epistemic
uncertainty of calibration-related quantities leads to absolute error in the
sensor output as high as 5.3 {\deg}C (and relative error as high as 25.7%) for
one commonly-used thermopile sensor. In one instance of using the epistemic
uncertainty information in edge detection, we show reduction of false-positives
edges to zero for the conventional Canny operator, while maintaining accuracy.
We show these ideas are practical and possible on actual embedded sensor
systems by prototyping them on two commercially-available uncertainty tracking
hardware platforms, one with average power dissipation 16.7 mW and 42.9x
speedup compared to the equal-confidence Monte Carlo computation (the status
quo), and the other with average power dissipation 147.15 mW and 94.4x speedup,
paving the way for use in real time.
