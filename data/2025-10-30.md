Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该研究提出了两种基于分布式学习的自动调制识别方法，通过多个接收器协作来执行AMR任务，在显著降低带宽需求的同时提高了识别准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的集中式AMR方法需要将所有训练数据收集到高功率计算设备上处理，这在带宽受限的无线网络中不切实际。

Method: 提出了两种分布式学习方法：1）基于共识投票的方法；2）特征图共享与中心节点聚合的方法。

Result: 集中式AMR（6个接收器）准确率达91%，单个接收器仅41%。分布式方法在显著降低带宽需求（分别减少到1/256和1/8）的同时，准确率得到显著提升。

Conclusion: 分布式AMR能够在有效应对带宽受限无线网络约束的同时，显著提高识别准确率。

Abstract: Automatic Modulation Recognition (AMR) is critical in identifying various
modulation types in wireless communication systems. Recent advancements in deep
learning have facilitated the integration of algorithms into AMR techniques.
However, this integration typically follows a centralized approach that
necessitates collecting and processing all training data on high-powered
computing devices, which may prove impractical for bandwidth-limited wireless
networks. In response to this challenge, this study introduces two methods for
distributed learning-based AMR on the collaboration of multiple receivers to
perform AMR tasks. The TeMuRAMRD 2023 dataset is employed to support this
investigation, uniquely suited for multi-receiver AMR tasks. Within this
distributed sensing environment, multiple receivers collaborate in identifying
modulation types from the same RF signal, each possessing a partial perspective
of the overall environment. Experimental results demonstrate that the
centralized-based AMR, with six receivers, attains an impressive accuracy rate
of 91%, while individual receivers exhibit a notably lower accuracy, at around
41%. Nonetheless, the two proposed decentralized learning-based AMR methods
exhibit noteworthy enhancements. Based on consensus voting among six receivers,
the initial method achieves a marginally lower accuracy. It achieves this while
substantially reducing the bandwidth demands to a 1/256th of the centralized
model. With the second distributed method, each receiver shares its feature
map, subsequently aggregated by a central node. This approach also accompanies
a substantial bandwidth reduction of 1/8 compared to the centralized approach.
These findings highlight the capacity of distributed AMR to significantly
enhance accuracy while effectively addressing the constraints of
bandwidth-limited wireless networks.

*Masoud Kaveh,Farshad Rostami Ghadi,Riku Jantti,Kai-Kit Wong,F. Javier Lopez-Martinez*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该论文研究将流体可重构智能表面(FRIS)集成到环境反向散射通信(AmBC)系统中，通过动态调整流体元件位置来增强空间适应性，并使用粒子群优化算法优化配置，显著提升了系统吞吐量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RIS具有固定位置元件，在直接链路弱或被障碍物阻挡的场景下性能受限。FRIS通过流体元件的动态位置调整提供更好的空间适应性，改善AmBC系统性能。

Method: 开发了FRIS辅助的AmBC系统模型，将FRIS元件位置优化建模为非凸问题，并采用粒子群优化(PSO)算法来获得近最优的流体元件配置。

Result: 仿真结果表明，FRIS辅助的AmBC系统在可实现吞吐量方面显著优于传统的RIS基AmBC系统。

Conclusion: FRIS通过动态位置调整增强了AmBC系统的空间适应性，在弱直接链路场景下提供了更好的通信性能，证明了流体可重构智能表面在环境反向散射通信中的优势。

Abstract: This paper investigates the integration of a fluid reconfigurable intelligent
surface (FRIS) into ambient backscatter communication (AmBC) systems. Unlike
conventional reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) with fixed position
elements, FRIS employs fluidic elements that can dynamically adjust their
positions, offering enhanced spatial adaptability. We develop a system model
where an AmBC tag communicates with a reader through an FRIS, which is
particularly beneficial in scenarios where the direct tag-to-reader link is
weak or blocked by obstacles. The achievable backscatter rate is analyzed, and
the optimization of FRIS element positions is formulated as a non-convex
problem. To address this, we employ particle swarm optimization (PSO) to obtain
near-optimal configurations of the fluid elements. Simulation results
demonstrate that FRIS-aided AmBC significantly outperforms conventional
RIS-based AmBC systems in terms of achievable throughput.

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了在真实环境中获取足够情境数据的挑战，为理解情绪状态与行为关系提供了有效框架。

Abstract: Measuring emotional states in transportation contexts is an emerging field.
Methods based on self-reported emotions are limited by their low granularity
and their susceptibility to memory bias. In contrast, methods based on
physiological indicators provide continuous data, enabling researchers to
measure changes in emotional states with high detail and accuracy. Not only are
emotions important in the analysis, but understanding what triggers emotional
changes is equally important. Uncontrolled variables such as traffic
conditions, pedestrian interactions, and infrastructure remain a significant
challenge, as they can have a great impact on emotional states. Explaining the
reasons behind these emotional states requires gathering sufficient and proper
contextual data, which can be extremely difficult in real-world environments.
This paper addresses these challenges by applying an innovative approach,
extracting contextual data (expert annotator level) from recorded multimedia
using large language models (LLMs). In this paper, data are collected from an
urban cycling case study of the City of Santiago, Chile. The applied models
focus on understanding how different environments and traffic situations affect
the emotional states and behaviors of the participants using physiological
data. Sequences of images, extracted from the recorded videos, are processed by
LLMs to obtain semantic descriptions of the environment. These discrete,
although dense and detailed, contextual data are integrated into a hybrid
model, where fatigue and arousal serve as latent variables influencing observed
cycling behaviors (inferred from GPS data) like waiting, accelerating, braking,
etc. The study confirms that cycling decisions are influenced by stress-related
emotions and highlights the strong impact of urban characteristics and traffic
conditions on cyclist behavior.

Conclusion: 该方案展示了在实际ARIS部署中的强大潜力，能够有效应对无人机飞行动态带来的挑战。

Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has emerged as a pivotal technology
for enhancing wireless networks. Compared to terrestrial RIS deployed on
building facades, aerial RIS (ARIS) mounted on quadrotor unmanned aerial
vehicle (UAV) offers superior flexibility and extended coverage. However, the
inevitable tilt and altitude variations of a quadrotor UAV during flight may
lead to severe beam misalignment, significantly degrading ARIS's performance.
To address this challenge, we propose a Euler angles-based ARIS control scheme
that jointly optimizes the altitude and trajectory of the ARIS by leveraging
the UAV's dynamic model. Considering the constraints on ARIS flight energy
consumption, flight safety, and the transmission power of a base station (BS),
we jointly design the ARIS's altitude, trajectory, phase shifts, and BS
beamforming to maximize the system sum-rate. Due to the continuous control
nature of ARIS flight and the strong coupling among variables, we formulate the
problem as a Markov decision process and adopt a soft actor-critic algorithm
with prioritized experience replay to learn efficient ARIS control policies.
Based on the optimized ARIS configuration, we further employ the water-filling
and bisection method to efficiently determine the optimal BS beamforming.
Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm significantly
outperforms benchmarks in both convergence and communication performance,
achieving approximately 14.4\% improvement in sum-rate. Moreover, in comparison
to the fixed-horizontal ARIS scheme, the proposed scheme yields more adaptive
trajectories and significantly mitigates performance degradation caused by ARIS
tilting, demonstrating strong potential for practical ARIS deployment.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该论文研究非侵入性脑电信号（EEG和MEG）的建模和解码，重点关注视觉刺激感知和内心语音的解码性能提升，通过深度学习方法处理被试间变异性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大脑在感知视觉刺激或进行内心语音时的活动机制，并提升此类刺激的解码性能，同时解决脑电记录中存在的大变异性问题。

Method: 分为方法学和工作实验两部分：方法学部分使用深度学习进行脑解码，包括个体水平的线性模型、处理被试间变异性的群体解码方法，以及基于卷积和Transformer架构的MEG数据预测模型；实验部分收集了包含EEG、MEG和OPM的高试验次数内心语音数据集。

Conclusion: 深度学习特别是Transformer架构在脑电信号建模方面具有优势，但内心语音解码仍然是一个极具挑战性的问题，需要进一步研究。

Abstract: This thesis delves into the world of non-invasive electrophysiological brain
signals like electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG),
focusing on modelling and decoding such data. The research aims to investigate
what happens in the brain when we perceive visual stimuli or engage in covert
speech (inner speech) and enhance the decoding performance of such stimuli. The
thesis is divided into two main sections, methodological and experimental work.
A central concern in both sections is the large variability present in
electrophysiological recordings, whether it be within-subject or
between-subject variability, and to a certain extent between-dataset
variability. In the methodological sections, we explore the potential of deep
learning for brain decoding. We present advancements in decoding visual stimuli
using linear models at the individual subject level. We then explore how deep
learning techniques can be employed for group decoding, introducing new methods
to deal with between-subject variability. Finally, we also explores novel
forecasting models of MEG data based on convolutional and Transformer-based
architectures. In particular, Transformer-based models demonstrate superior
capabilities in generating signals that closely match real brain data, thereby
enhancing the accuracy and reliability of modelling the brain's
electrophysiology. In the experimental section, we present a unique dataset
containing high-trial inner speech EEG, MEG, and preliminary optically pumped
magnetometer (OPM) data. Our aim is to investigate different types of inner
speech and push decoding performance by collecting a high number of trials and
sessions from a few participants. However, the decoding results are found to be
mostly negative, underscoring the difficulty of decoding inner speech.

*Tianheng Ling,Chao Qian,Peter Zdankin,Torben Weis,Gregor Schiele*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: StrikeWatch是一个紧凑型腕戴系统，通过IMU信号在设备上实时进行步态识别，专门检测脚跟与脚前掌着地模式，为跑步者提供视觉和听觉反馈来纠正有害步态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 跑步有益健康但不正确的步态模式可能导致损伤，现有步态分析系统笨重且仅限于离线分析，腕戴设备更实用但实时步态识别面临IMU信号噪声、计算资源有限和依赖云连接的挑战。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了模型复杂度和硬件效率之间的权衡，紧凑量化模型在资源受限设备上实现了高效的实时步态识别。

Abstract: Running offers substantial health benefits, but improper gait patterns can
lead to injuries, particularly without expert feedback. While prior gait
analysis systems based on cameras, insoles, or body-mounted sensors have
demonstrated effectiveness, they are often bulky and limited to offline,
post-run analysis. Wrist-worn wearables offer a more practical and
non-intrusive alternative, yet enabling real-time gait recognition on such
devices remains challenging due to noisy Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU)
signals, limited computing resources, and dependence on cloud connectivity.
This paper introduces StrikeWatch, a compact wrist-worn system that performs
entirely on-device, real-time gait recognition using IMU signals. As a case
study, we target the detection of heel versus forefoot strikes to enable
runners to self-correct harmful gait patterns through visual and auditory
feedback during running. We propose four compact DL architectures (1D-CNN,
1D-SepCNN, LSTM, and Transformer) and optimize them for energy-efficient
inference on two representative embedded Field-Programmable Gate Arrays
(FPGAs): the AMD Spartan-7 XC7S15 and the Lattice iCE40UP5K. Using our
custom-built hardware prototype, we collect a labeled dataset from outdoor
running sessions and evaluate all models via a fully automated deployment
pipeline. Our results reveal clear trade-offs between model complexity and
hardware efficiency. Evaluated across 12 participants, 6-bit quantized
1D-SepCNN achieves the highest average F1 score of 0.847 while consuming just
0.350 {\mu}J per inference with a latency of 0.140 ms on the iCE40UP5K running
at 20 MHz. This configuration supports up to 13.6 days of continuous inference
on a 320 mAh battery. All datasets and code are available in the GitHub
repository https://github.com/tianheng-ling/StrikeWatch.

### [8] [Comparative Analysis of Data Augmentation for Clinical ECG Classification with STAR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24740)
*Nader Nemati*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: STAR是一种针对12导联心电图的节拍级数据增强方法，通过在R-R间期内进行受控的时间扭曲和幅度缩放，保留P-QRS-T波形顺序，提高模型泛化能力而不破坏临床关键形态特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床12导联心电图分类面临记录条件多样、病理重叠和标签不平衡等挑战，传统数据增强方法可能扭曲诊断关键形态特征，需要一种既能增加训练多样性又能保持临床形态完整性的增强方法。

Method: STAR在连续R峰之间对每个R-R段应用受控时间扭曲和幅度缩放，严格保留P-QRS-T波形顺序，不改变信号的头尾部分，可与常见1D SE-ResNet风格ECG编码器集成。

Result: STAR提供了形态保真变异性，提高了跨设备、站点和队列的训练稳定性，无需数据集特定调优，并通过节拍级增强改善了罕见类别的学习效果。

Conclusion: STAR为临床ECG分类提供了一种简单可控的数据增强方法，在需要可信形态、操作简单性和跨源耐久性的场景中具有重要价值。

Abstract: Clinical 12-lead ECG classification remains difficult because of diverse
recording conditions, overlapping pathologies, and pronounced label imbalance
hinder generalization, while unconstrained augmentations risk distorting
diagnostically critical morphology. In this study, Sinusoidal Time--Amplitude
Resampling (STAR) is introduced as a beat-wise augmentation that operates
strictly between successive R-peaks to apply controlled time warping and
amplitude scaling to each R--R segment, preserving the canonical P--QRS--T
order and leaving the head and tail of the trace unchanged. STAR is designed
for practical pipelines and offers: (i) morphology-faithful variability that
broadens training diversity without corrupting peaks or intervals; (ii)
source-resilient training, improving stability across devices, sites, and
cohorts without dataset-specific tuning; (iii) model-agnostic integration with
common 1D SE--ResNet-style ECG encoders backbone; and (iv) better learning on
rare classes via beat-level augmentation, reducing overfitting by resampling
informative beats instead of duplicating whole records. In contrast to global
crops, large shifts, or additive noise, STAR avoids transformations that
suppress or misalign clinical landmarks. A complete Python implementation and a
transparent training workflow are released, aligned with a source-aware,
stratified five-fold protocol over a multi-institutional 12-lead corpus,
thereby facilitating inspection and reuse. Taken together, STAR provides a
simple and controllable augmentation for clinical ECG classification where
trustworthy morphology, operational simplicity, and cross-source durability are
essential.

Abstract: Non-intrusive monitoring of vital signs has become increasingly important in
a variety of healthcare settings. In this paper, we present PulseFi, a novel
low-cost non-intrusive system that uses Wi-Fi sensing and artificial
intelligence to accurately and continuously monitor heart rate and breathing
rate, as well as detect apnea events. PulseFi operates using low-cost commodity
devices, making it more accessible and cost-effective. It uses a signal
processing pipeline to process Wi-Fi telemetry data, specifically Channel State
Information (CSI), that is fed into a custom low-compute Long Short-Term Memory
(LSTM) neural network model. We evaluate PulseFi using two datasets: one that
we collected locally using ESP32 devices and another that contains recordings
of 118 participants collected using the Raspberry Pi 4B, making the latter the
most comprehensive data set of its kind. Our results show that PulseFi can
effectively estimate heart rate and breathing rate in a seemless non-intrusive
way with comparable or better accuracy than multiple antenna systems that can
be expensive and less accessible.

*Dong-Hyeon Kang,Ju-Hyeon Nam,Sang-Chul Lee*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: EcoScale-Net是一种高效的卷积全尺度网络，通过分层设计和瓶颈卷积，在保持全感受野覆盖的同时大幅降低计算成本，在ECG分类任务中实现了SOTA精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CNN分类器难以选择适合ECG长序列的感受野大小，而OS CNN虽然通过枚举素数大小内核覆盖所有尺度，但计算成本过高，阻碍了更深更宽的模型设计。

Method: 提出分层变体EcoScale-Net，在每个阶段限制最大内核长度，并在每个全尺度块前后插入瓶颈卷积来控制通道增长和融合多尺度特征。

Result: 在CODE 15% ECG数据集上，相比OS CNN，参数减少90%，FLOPs减少99%，同时宏平均F1分数提高2.4%。

Conclusion: EcoScale-Net以极低的计算成本实现了长序列ECG分类的最先进精度，可在普通硬件上实时部署。

Abstract: Accurate interpretation of 12 lead electrocardiograms (ECGs) is critical for
early detection of cardiac abnormalities, yet manual reading is error prone and
existing CNN based classifiers struggle to choose receptive field sizes that
generalize to the long sequences typical of ECGs. Omni Scale CNN (OS CNN)
addresses this by enumerating prime sized kernels inspired by Goldbach
conjecture to cover every scale, but its exhaustive design explodes
computational cost and blocks deeper, wider models. We present Efficient
Convolutional Omni Scale Network (EcoScale-Net), a hierarchical variant that
retains full receptive field coverage while eliminating redundancy. At each
stage, the maximum kernel length is capped to the scale still required after
down sampling, and bottleneck convolutions inserted before and after every Omni
Scale block curtail channel growth and fuse multi scale features. On the large
scale CODE 15% ECG dataset, EcoScaleNet reduces parameters by 90% and FLOPs by
99% compared with OS CNN, while raising macro averaged F1 score by 2.4%. These
results demonstrate that EcoScaleNet delivers SOTA accuracy for long sequence
ECG classification at a fraction of the computational cost, enabling real time
deployment on commodity hardware. Our EcoScaleNet code is available in GitHub
Link.

Abstract: Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome is a congenital cardiac condition
associated with sudden cardiac death, with a prevalence of 0.1-0.3%.
Conventional screening relies on electrophysiological testing or 12-lead
electrocardiography interpreted by cardiologists, which limits large-scale and
cost-effective screening. Building on our previous work developing a
single-lead AI-ECG mobile system for atrial fibrillation screening, this study
evaluates its efficiency and effectiveness for opportunistic detection of WPW
syndrome in real-world settings. This retrospective analysis included 3,566,626
single-lead ECG recordings from 87,836 individuals in China, collected using
the NMPA-approved portable ECG device WenXinWuYang. The AI system performance
was validated using cardiologist annotations and random sampling. We quantified
AI-assisted workload reduction and compared review efficiency across
AI-positive and user-initiated workflows. The AI system achieved 45.5%
sensitivity and 95.9% specificity. A positive AI result indicated about 210
times higher risk of confirmed WPW. Focusing on AI-selected positives reduced
physician workload by 99.5%, requiring only 12 reviews to confirm one WPW case,
compared with 909 and 875 in population-wide and user-driven approaches. In
conclusion, this large-scale real-world study demonstrates that a single-lead
AI-ECG system enables efficient and practical opportunistic screening for WPW
syndrome, significantly reducing physician workload and supporting
population-based cardiovascular prevention.

Conclusion: 增强的结构可调性和阵列配置为未来基于混合物和空间调制的分子通信系统提供了灵活基础，为IoNT框架内可扩展和多功能接收器架构铺平了道路。

Abstract: Molecular communication (MC) enables biocompatible and energy-efficient
information transfer through chemical signaling, forming a foundational
paradigm for emerging applications in the Internet of Nano Things (IoNT) and
intrabody healthcare systems. The realization of this vision critically depends
on developing advanced receiver architectures that merge nanoscale
communication and networking techniques with bio-cyber interfaces, ensuring
energy-efficient, reliable, and low-complexity modulation and detection while
maintaining biocompatibility. To address these challenges, the Flexure-FET MC
receiver was introduced as a mechanically transducing design capable of
detecting both charged and neutral molecular species. In this study, we present
a cylindrical nanowire array-based Flexure-FET MC receiver that enhances design
versatility and scalability through distributed electromechanical coupling in a
suspended-gate configuration. The proposed array architecture offers additional
geometric degrees of freedom, including nanowire radius, length, spacing, and
array size, providing a flexible framework that can be tailored to advanced MC
scenarios. An analytical end-to-end model is developed to characterize the
system's electromechanical response, noise behavior, and information-theoretic
performance, including signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and channel capacity. The
results reveal the strong interdependence between geometry, electromechanical
dynamics, and molecular binding processes, enabling tunable control over
sensitivity, noise characteristics, and communication capacity. The enhanced
structural tunability and array configuration of the proposed design provide a
flexible foundation for future mixture-based and spatially modulated MC
systems, paving the way toward scalable and multifunctional receiver
architectures within the IoNT framework.

TL;DR: 提出了一种动态分片MAC协议(DyFrag-MAC)，通过动态分片普通优先级数据来支持紧急优先级数据的早期传输，解决了工业CPS中异构优先级流量的信道访问问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业CPS中连接设备数量激增，需要可靠及时的网络服务。现有协议无法在单信道中动态抢占低优先级传输，导致紧急数据等待时间过长。

Method: DyFrag-MAC通过动态分片普通优先级数据包，允许紧急优先级数据在低优先级传输过程中抢占信道，实现差异化信道访问。

Result: 与FROG-MAC和i-DSME相比，DyFrag-MAC在平均延迟和吞吐量方面表现更优，特别适合异构流量场景。

Abstract: Next Generation Media Access Control (NGMA) techniques have been designed to
support diverse applications with heterogeneous priorities. In industrial
cyber-physical systems (CPS), the number of connected devices and systems is
expected to grow significantly, demanding dependable and prompt network
services. In this work, we present a novel scheme, Dynamic Fragmentation-MAC
(DyFrag-MAC) that offers dynamic, differentiated channel access to the traffic
of various priorities. DyFrag-MAC works on fragmenting the data of normal
priority in order to support early delivery of urgent priority data. In prior
work, urgent priority data either had to wait for the complete transmission of
lower-priority packets or relied on multi-channel protocols to gain access. We
compared the proposed fragmentation scheme with FROG-MAC and industrial
Deterministic and Synchronous Multi-channel Extension (i-DSME). FROG-MAC
fragmented the lower priority packets, but did not adjust the fragment size
dynamically, whereas i-DSME utilized multiple channels and adaptive contention
mechanisms; both protocols lack the ability to preempt ongoing lower-priority
transmissions. Hence, the performance evaluation in terms of average delay and
throughput reveals better performance of DyFRAG-MAC for the heterogeneous
traffic.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于无线体域网的新型优先级MAC协议ADP2-MAC，通过概率性方法动态确定信道轮询间隔，并支持中断低优先级数据传输来处理紧急数据包。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在无线体域网中高效管理具有不同优先级的异构流量至关重要，现有MAC协议的优先级机制在可靠性、延迟和能效方面存在优化空间，特别是需要针对不同流量优先级进行延迟优化。

Method: ADP2-MAC协议采用概率性方法动态确定信道轮询/监听间隔，识别流量到达模式以确定最优轮询间隔，并在预期紧急数据包时中断低优先级数据的传输。

Result: 与支持异构流量的MVDR协议相比，ADP2-MAC在性能上表现更优，这得益于其概率性轮询间隔和专门设计用于高效处理紧急优先级数据的中断机制。

Conclusion: ADP2-MAC协议通过动态轮询间隔和中断机制，能够有效支持无线体域网中的异构流量，在延迟优化和紧急数据处理方面优于现有协议。

Abstract: Efficient management of heterogeneous traffic with varying priorities is
critical in Wireless Body Area Networks (WBANs). The priority mechanisms
embedded in Media Access Control (MAC) schemes largely govern the performance
of WBAN in terms of reliability, delay and energy efficiency. Minimizing the
delay between packet generation and reception is critical for enhancing WBAN
performance and associated health outcomes; however, delay optimization must be
tailored to each traffic priority. In this work, we proposed a novel
priority-based MAC protocol, Adaptive and Dynamic Polling MAC for Prioritized
Traffic (ADP2-MAC), designed to support heterogeneous traffic in WBANs. The
protocol utilizes a probabilistic approach to dynamically determine channel
polling/listening intervals. ADP2-MAC not only identifies traffic arrival
patterns to determine optimal polling intervals but also interrupts the
transmission of lower-priority data when urgent packets are expected. The
performance of ADP2-MAC has been compared with the MAC protocol for Variable
Data Rates (MVDR) which supports heterogeneous traffic by assigning different
data rates based on traffic priority. ADP2-MAC outperforms MVDR due to its use
of probabilistic polling intervals and an interruption mechanism designed to
efficiently handle urgent-priority data.

Conclusion: 这种混合方法保持了随机有限集框架固有的多目标跟踪优势，同时提高了灵活性和鲁棒性，为复杂机动目标跟踪提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: This work addresses the problem of tracking maneuvering objects with complex
motion patterns, a task in which conventional methods often struggle due to
their reliance on predefined motion models. We integrate a data-driven liquid
neural network (LNN) into the random finite set (RFS) framework, leading to two
LNN-RFS filters. By learning continuous-time dynamics directly from data, the
LNN enables the filters to adapt to complex, nonlinear motion and achieve
accurate tracking of highly maneuvering objects in clutter. This hybrid
approach preserves the inherent multi-object tracking strengths of the RFS
framework while improving flexibility and robustness. Simulation results on
challenging maneuvering scenarios demonstrate substantial gains of the proposed
hybrid approach in tracking accuracy.

TL;DR: 提出了针对捏合天线系统的联合发射和捏合波束成形设计，用于权衡频谱效率和能量效率，包括单用户和多用户场景的解决方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多天线系统在频谱效率和能量效率之间存在权衡，需要开发新的系统架构和算法来优化这一权衡。

Method: 单用户场景采用两阶段联合波束成形设计：第一阶段提出迭代闭式细化方案对齐接收信号相位并确定PA位置；第二阶段推导最优发射波束成形器。多用户场景采用基于交替优化的联合波束成形设计。

Result: 所提算法显著改善了联合SE-EE性能，收敛速度快；随着PA数量和服务覆盖范围增加，PASS与传统多天线系统之间的SE-EE权衡差距扩大。

Conclusion: PASS系统在SE-EE权衡方面优于传统多天线系统，特别是在PA数量和服务覆盖范围较大的情况下。

Abstract: The joint transmit and pinching beamforming design for spectral efficiency
(SE) and energy efficiency (EE) tradeoff in pinching-antenna systems (PASS) is
proposed. Both PASS-enabled single- and multi-user communications are
considered. In the single-user scenario, it is proved that the optimal pinching
antenna (PA) positions are independent of the transmit beamforming. Based on
this insight, a two-stage joint beamforming design is proposed. Specifically,
in the first stage, an iterative closed-form refinement (ICR) scheme is
proposed to align the phases of the received signals, based on which a PA
placement framework is proposed. In the second stage, the closed-form solution
for the optimal transmit beamformer is derived given the optimal PA positions.
In the multi-user scenario, an alternating optimization (AO)-based joint
beamforming design is proposed to balance the SE-EE performance while taking
the quality-of-service (QoS) requirements into account. It is proved that the
proposed AO-based algorithm is guaranteed to converge when no constraints are
violated in PA placement subproblem. Numerical results demonstrate that: 1) the
proposed algorithms significantly improve joint SE-EE performance with fast
convergence speed; 2) the SE-EE tradeoff regime gap between PASS and
conventional multi-antenna system widens as the number of PAs and service
coverage increase.

Conclusion: FA-Stateformer通过状态空间和自注意力的协同建模，在保持高表示能力的同时实现了计算效率的平衡。

Abstract: Accurate direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation for sound sources is
challenging due to the continuous changes in acoustic characteristics across
time and frequency. In such scenarios, accurate localization relies on the
ability to aggregate relevant features and model temporal dependencies
effectively. In time series modeling, achieving a balance between model
performance and computational efficiency remains a significant challenge. To
address this, we propose FA-Stateformer, a state space and self-attention
collaborative network with feature aggregation. The proposed network first
employs a feature aggregation module to enhance informative features across
both temporal and spectral dimensions. This is followed by a lightweight
Conformer architecture inspired by the squeeze-and-excitation mechanism, where
the feedforward layers are compressed to reduce redundancy and parameter
overhead. Additionally, a temporal shift mechanism is incorporated to expand
the receptive field of convolutional layers while maintaining a compact kernel
size. To further enhance sequence modeling capabilities, a bidirectional Mamba
module is introduced, enabling efficient state-space-based representation of
temporal dependencies in both forward and backward directions. The remaining
self-attention layers are combined with the Mamba blocks, forming a
collaborative modeling framework that achieves a balance between representation
capacity and computational efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
FA-Stateformer achieves superior performance and efficiency compared to
conventional architectures.

Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is a promising solution for the
future sixth-generation (6G) system. However, classical fixed-position antenna
(FPA) ISAC systems fail to fully utilize spatial degrees of freedom (DoFs),
resulting in limited gains for both radar sensing and communication
functionalities. This challenge can be addressed by the emerging novel movable
antenna (MA) technology, which can pursue better channel conditions and improve
sensing and communication performances. In this paper, we aim to minimize the
Cram\'er-Rao bound (CRB) for estimating the target's angle while guaranteeing
communication performance. This involves jointly optimizing active beamforming,
power allocation, receiving filters, and MA position configurations, which is a
highly non-convex problem. To tackle this difficulty, we propose an efficient
iterative solution that analytically optimizes all variables without relying on
numerical solvers, i.e., CVX. Specifically, by leveraging cutting-edge
majorization-minimization (MM) and penalty-dual-decomposition (PDD) methods, we
develop a low-complexity algorithm to solve the beamformer configuration
problem containing the fractional and quartic terms. Numerical simulation
results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed algorithm,
highlighting significant performance improvements achieved by employing MA in
the ISAC system.

Abstract: This paper explores a multi-cell multiple-input single-output (MISO) downlink
communication system enabled by a unique transmissive reconfigurable
intelligent surface (RIS) transceiver (TRTC) configuration. Within this system
framework, we formulate an optimization problem for the purpose of maximizing
the minimum rate of users for each cell via designing the transmit beamforming
of the TRTC, subject to the power constraints of each TRTC unit. Since the
objective function is non-differentiable, the max-min rate problem is difficult
to solve. In order to tackle this challenging optimization problem, an
efficient low-complexity optimization algorithm is developed. Specifically, the
log-form rate function is transformed into a tractable form by employing the
fractional programming (FP) methodology. Next, the max-min objective function
can be approximated using a differentiable function derived from smooth
approximation theory. Moreover, by applying the majorization-minimization (MM)
technique and examining the optimality conditions, a solution is proposed that
updates all variables analytically without relying on any numerical solvers.
Numerical results are presented to demonstrate the convergence and
effectiveness of the proposed low-complexity algorithm. Additionally, the
algorithm can significantly reduce the computational complexity without
performance loss. Furthermore, the simulation results illustrate the clear
superiority of the deployment of the TRTC over the benchmark schemes.

Abstract: This study demonstrates the feasibility of radar-based non-contact
respiratory monitoring for wombats. Two measurement experiments were conducted
in June and December 2024 using 79-GHz millimeter-wave radar systems to monitor
the respiration of two wombats. To estimate the respiratory interval, we used a
method based on summing harmonic components in the autocorrelation function,
capturing the quasi-periodic displacement of the body surface caused by
respiration. Estimation accuracy was evaluated through simultaneous
measurements from different angles using two radar units. The respiratory
interval and respiratory rate were measured with errors of 47.4 ms (2.44%) and
0.81 bpm (2.21%), respectively. We also discuss the differences in respiratory
rates between the two wombats, as well as seasonal variations between June and
December. The results support the potential application of this method to
non-contact health monitoring of wombats.

Abstract: Accurate channel state information (CSI) is critical for current and
next-generation multi-antenna systems. Yet conventional pilot-based estimators
incur prohibitive overhead as antenna counts grow. In this paper, we address
this challenge by developing a novel framework based on Gaussian process
regression (GPR) that predicts full CSI from only a few observed entries,
thereby reducing pilot overhead. The correlation between data points in GPR is
defined by the covariance function, known as kernels. In the proposed GPR-based
CSI estimation framework, we incorporate three kernels, i.e., radial basis
function, Mat\'ern, and rational quadratic, to model smooth and multi-scale
spatial correlations derived from the antenna array geometry. The proposed
approach is evaluated across Kronecker and Weichselberger channel models with
three distinct pilot probing schemes. Results show that the proposed GPR with
50% pilot saving achieves the lowest prediction error, the highest empirical
95% credible-interval coverage, and the best preservation of mutual information
relative to benchmarks. This enables up to 50% pilot reduction while preserving
over 92% of the link capacity.

Abstract: Satellite-based communications are expected to be a substantial future market
in 6G networks. As satellite constellations grow denser and transmission
resources remain limited, frequency reuse plays an increasingly important role
in managing inter-user interference. In the multi-user downlink, precoding
enables the reuse of frequencies across spatially separated users, greatly
improving spectral efficiency. The analytical calculation of suitable
precodings for perfect channel information is well studied, however, their
performance can quickly deteriorate when faced with, e.g., outdated channel
state information or, as is particularly relevant for satellite channels, when
position estimates are erroneous. Deriving robust precoders under imperfect
channel state information is not only analytically intractable in general but
often requires substantial relaxations of the optimization problem or heuristic
constraints to obtain feasible solutions. Instead, in this paper we flexibly
derive robust precoding algorithms from given data using reinforcement
learning. We describe how we adapt the applied Soft Actor-Critic learning
algorithm to the problem of downlink satellite beamforming and show numerically
that the resulting precoding algorithm adjusts to all investigated scenarios.
The considered scenarios cover both single satellite and cooperative
multi-satellite beamforming, using either global or local channel state
information, and two error models that represent increasing levels of
uncertainty. We show that the learned algorithms match or markedly outperform
two analytical baselines in sum rate performance, adapting to the required
level of robustness. We also analyze the mechanisms that the learned algorithms
leverage to achieve robustness. The implementation is publicly available for
use and reproduction of the results.

Abstract: The advent of artificial intelligence (AI)-native wireless communication is
fundamentally reshaping the design paradigm of next-generation (NextG) systems,
where intelligent air interfaces are expected to operate adaptively and
efficiently in highly dynamic environments. Conventional orthogonal frequency
division multiplexing (OFDM) systems rely heavily on pilots and the cyclic
prefix (CP), resulting in significant overhead and reduced spectral efficiency.
To address these limitations, we propose an adaptive end-to-end (E2E)
transceiver architecture tailored for pilot-free and CP-free wireless systems.
The architecture combines AI-driven constellation shaping and a neural receiver
through joint training. To enhance robustness against mismatched or
time-varying channel conditions, we introduce a lightweight channel adapter
(CA) module, which enables rapid adaptation with minimal computational overhead
by updating only the CA parameters. Additionally, we present a framework that
is scalable to multiple modulation orders within a unified model, significantly
reducing model storage requirements. Moreover, to tackle the high
peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) inherent to OFDM, we incorporate constrained
E2E training, achieving compliance with PAPR targets without additional
transmission overhead. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed
framework delivers superior bit error rate (BER), throughput, and resilience
across diverse channel scenarios, highlighting its potential for AI-native

Abstract: Terahertz (THz) band is considered a promising candidate to meet the
high-throughput requirement for future sixth-generation (6G) wireless
communications due to its ultrawide bandwidth. However, due to the high
penetration loss at high-frequencies, blockage becomes a serious problem in THz
communications, especially in near-field indoor communications with numerous
obstacles. To address this issue, this paper investigates blockage-resilient
near-field beam training based on self-accelerating Airy beam, which can
propagate along a curved trajectory to circumvent obstacles. Specifically, we
first analyze the trajectory of the Airy beam and the beam pattern at the
receiver using a discrete Fourier transform (DFT) codebook in the presence of
obstacles. Interestingly, we reveal that the beam pattern not only captures the
receiver's location information but also implicitly encodes the spatial
relationship between the receiver and obstacle, which facilitates identifying
the optimal Airy beam configuration. Based on this insight, we formulate the
blockage-resilient beam training task as a multitask learning problem and
propose a lightweight attention-based multi-parameter beam training network
(AMPBT-Net) to jointly predict the angle, distance, and curvature parameters of
the optimal Airy beam based on the beam pattern. Finally, simulation results
demonstrate that the Airy beam effectively mitigates blockage effects and the
proposed scheme achieves comparable performance to exhaustive beam sweeping
while significantly reducing training overhead.

Abstract: In this paper, we consider a dynamic radio frequency sensing system aiming to
spatially track multiple targets over time. We develop a conditional denoising
diffusion probabilistic model (C-DDPM)-assisted framework that learns the
temporal evolution of target parameters by leveraging the noisy echo
observations as conditioning features. The proposed framework integrates a
variational autoencoder (VAE) for echo compression and utilizes classifier-free
guidance to enhance conditional denoising. In each transmission block, VAE
encodes the received echo into a latent representation that conditions DDPM to
predict future target states, which are then used for codebook beam selection.
Simulation results show that the proposed approach outperforms classical signal
processing, filtering, and deep learning benchmarks. The C-DDPM-assisted
framework achieves significantly lower estimation errors in both angle and
distance tracking, demonstrating the potential of generative models for
integrated sensing and communications.

estimator and quantized phase feedback. Analysis closely matches Monte Carlo
simulations and yields concrete design rules: with a surface of N=64 pixels,
pilot length $M=2N$, and pilot SNR=20 dB, the normalized mean-squared error
is0.005, implying an effective-SNR loss of about 0.5 and a capacity penalty of
0.007bits-s. Six-bit phase quantization introduces no measurable additional
penalty at these operating points, setting a practical benchmark for feedback
resolution. Training overhead scales strongly with pixel geometry: halving
pixel width (quartering pixel area) increases the pilot length required to
maintain the same NMSE by roughly fourfold. The framework reconciles
physical-optics modeling with estimation-and-feedback design and provides a
principled basis for scalable link budgeting in RIS-assisted optical networks.

Conclusion: 深度强化学习在动态ISAC场景中具有实现实时高性能的潜力，显著优于传统优化方法和离散波束成形方法。

Abstract: Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) is a key enabler in 6G networks,
where sensing and communication capabilities are designed to complement and
enhance each other. One of the main challenges in ISAC lies in resource
allocation, which becomes computationally demanding in dynamic environments
requiring real-time adaptation. In this paper, we propose a Deep Reinforcement
Learning (DRL)-based approach for dynamic beamforming and power allocation in
ISAC systems. The DRL agent interacts with the environment and learns optimal
strategies through trial and error, guided by predefined rewards. Simulation
results show that the DRL-based solution converges within 2000 episodes and
achieves up to 80\% of the spectral efficiency of a semidefinite relaxation
(SDR) benchmark. More importantly, it offers a significant improvement in
runtime performance, achieving decision times of around 20 ms compared to 4500
ms for the SDR method. Furthermore, compared with a Deep Q-Network (DQN)
benchmark employing discrete beamforming, the proposed approach achieves
approximately 30\% higher sum-rate with comparable runtime. These results
highlight the potential of DRL for enabling real-time, high-performance ISAC in
dynamic scenarios.

Motivation: 工业4.0应用需要实时监控系统状态变化，但传感器通过无线链路传输数据时存在丢包问题，这会影响变化检测的准确性和及时性。

Method: 使用伯努利采样过程收集测量值，采用重传至成功的传输策略，构建包含DM测量值和队列长度的马尔可夫过程，提出CUSUM算法并扩展到多传感器场景。

Result: 证明了算法在误报率趋近于零时的渐近最优性，通过LCFS队列调度降低非渐近情况下的检测延迟，多传感器场景下通过调度算法平衡观测时效性和信息量。

Conclusion: 所提出的CUSUM算法能有效处理无线链路丢包情况下的变化检测问题，在单传感器和多传感器场景下均能实现良好的检测性能，为工业4.0系统设计提供优化指导。

Abstract: Motivated by Industry 4.0 applications, we consider quickest change detection
(QCD) of an abrupt change in a process when its measurements are transmitted by
a sensor over a lossy wireless link to a decision maker (DM). The sensor node
samples measurements using a Bernoulli sampling process, and places the
measurement samples in the transmit queue of its transmitter. The transmitter
uses a retransmit-until-success transmission strategy to deliver packets to the
DM over the lossy link, in which the packet losses are modeled as a Bernoulli
process, with different loss probabilities before and after the change. We pose
the QCD problem in the non-Bayesian setting under Lorden's framework, and
propose a CUSUM algorithm. By defining a suitable Markov process, involving the
DM measurements and the queue length process, we show that the problem reduces
to QCD in a Markov process. Characterizing the information measure per
measurement sample at the DM, we establish the asymptotic optimality of our
algorithm when the false alarm rate tends to zero. Further, when the DM
receives incomplete data due to channel loss, we present asymptotically optimal
QCD algorithms by suitably modifying the CUSUM algorithm. We then explore the
last-come-first-served (LCFS) queuing discipline at the sensor transmit queue
to lower detection delay in the non-asymptotic case. Next, we consider the case
of multiple sensors, each with its own wireless transmitter queue, and show
that our analysis extends to the case of multiple homogeneous sensors. When the
sensors are heterogeneous, we present a sensor scheduling algorithm that
minimizes detection delay by balancing the trade-off between the age of the
observations and their information content. Numerical analysis demonstrate
trade-offs that can be used to optimize system design parameters in the
non-asymptotic regime.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统波反演方法假设离散均匀层，需要密集测量或强先验知识，限制了在连续变化属性场景下的可扩展性和准确性。

Method: 使用物理信息机器学习框架，将地下介电常数重建为深度的连续神经网络函数，训练同时满足测量数据和麦克斯韦方程。

Result: 与现场介电常数测量结果高度一致（R²=0.93），对细微变化敏感（Δεr=2），在两层系统中仅需三个策略性放置的传感器即可恢复准确剖面。

Conclusion: 该方法将地下反演从边界驱动重构为连续属性估计，能够准确表征平滑介电常数变化，推动了使用低成本雷达系统的电磁成像技术。

Abstract: Estimating subsurface dielectric properties is essential for applications
ranging from environmental surveys of soils to nondestructive evaluation of
concrete in infrastructure. Conventional wave inversion methods typically
assume few discrete homogeneous layers and require dense measurements or strong
prior knowledge of material boundaries, limiting scalability and accuracy in
realistic settings where properties vary continuously. We present a physics
informed machine learning framework that reconstructs subsurface permittivity
as a fully neural, continuous function of depth, trained to satisfy both
measurement data and Maxwells equations. We validate the framework with both
simulations and custom built radar experiments on multilayered natural
materials. Results show close agreement with in-situ permittivity measurements
(R^2=0.93), with sensitivity to even subtle variations (Delta eps_r=2).
Parametric analysis reveals that accurate profiles can be recovered with as few
as three strategically placed sensors in two layer systems. This approach
reframes subsurface inversion from boundary-driven to continuous property
estimation, enabling accurate characterization of smooth permittivity
variations and advancing electromagnetic imaging using low cost radar systems.

Conclusion: 该实现使可微分粒子滤波器算法更易于被广泛研究社区访问，并促进了算法间的直接比较。

Abstract: State-space models (SSMs) are a widely used tool in time series analysis. In
the complex systems that arise from real-world data, it is common to employ
particle filtering (PF), an efficient Monte Carlo method for estimating the
hidden state corresponding to a sequence of observations. Applying particle
filtering requires specifying both the parametric form and the parameters of
the system, which are often unknown and must be estimated. Gradient-based
optimisation techniques cannot be applied directly to standard particle
filters, as the filters themselves are not differentiable. However, several
recently proposed methods modify the resampling step to make particle filtering
differentiable. In this paper, we present an implementation of several such
differentiable particle filters (DPFs) with a unified API built on the popular
PyTorch framework. Our implementation makes these algorithms easily accessible
to a broader research community and facilitates straightforward comparison
between them. We validate our framework by reproducing experiments from several
existing studies and demonstrate how DPFs can be applied to address several
common challenges with state space modelling.

Motivation: 传统相干方案使用QPSK或QAM调制需要导频进行信道估计，而Grassmannian信号具有噪声样分布特性，能够增强通信的隐蔽性和安全性。

Method: 结合直接序列扩频技术和Grassmannian信号设计非相干通信系统，利用Grassmannian星座的噪声分布特性实现低检测概率。

Result: 仿真显示在低信噪比下，Grassmannian信号提供竞争性误码率，同时在不期望接收端保持低检测概率，优于需要导频的相干方案。

Conclusion: 非相干Grassmannian信号在低检测概率通信中具有实用性和安全性优势，因其改进的隐蔽性和性能表现。

Abstract: This paper proposes a noncoherent low probability of detection (LPD)
communication system based on direct sequence spread spectrum (DSSS) and
Grassmannian signaling. Grassmannian constellations enhance covertness because
they tend to follow a noise-like distribution. Simulations showed that
Grassmannian signaling provides competitive bit error rates (BER) at low
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regimes with low probability of detection at the
unintended receiver compared to coherent schemes that use QPSK or QAM
modulation formats and need pilots to perform channel estimation. The results
suggest the practicality and security benefits of noncoherent Grassmannian
signaling for LPD communications due to their improved covertness and
performance.

Abstract: Ensuring secure and efficient multi-user (MU) transmission is critical for
vehicular communication systems. Chaos-based modulation schemes have garnered
considerable interest due to their benefits in physical layer security.
However, most existing MU chaotic communication systems, particularly those
based on non-coherent detection, suffer from low spectral efficiency due to
reference signal transmission, and limited user connectivity under orthogonal
multiple access (OMA). While non-orthogonal schemes, such as sparse code
multiple access (SCMA)-based DCSK, have been explored, they face high
computational complexity and inflexible scalability due to their fixed codebook
designs. This paper proposes a deep learning-assisted power domain
non-orthogonal multiple access chaos shift keying (DL-NOMA-CSK) system for
vehicular communications. A deep neural network (DNN)-based demodulator is
designed to learn intrinsic chaotic signal characteristics during offline
training, thereby eliminating the need for chaotic synchronization or reference
signal transmission. The demodulator employs a dual-domain feature extraction
architecture that jointly processes the time-domain and frequency-domain
information of chaotic signals, enhancing feature learning under dynamic
channels. The DNN is integrated into the successive interference cancellation
(SIC) framework to mitigate error propagation issues. Theoretical analysis and
extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed system achieves superior
performance in terms of spectral efficiency (SE), energy efficiency (EE), bit
error rate (BER), security, and robustness, while maintaining lower
computational complexity compared to traditional MU-DCSK and existing DL-aided
schemes. These advantages validate its practical viability for secure vehicular
communications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无线网络中的实时视频传输在有限带宽和弱连接等恶劣信道条件下仍然极具挑战，需要开发能够在受限信道下保持鲁棒性的轻量级传输方案。

Method: 采用弹性1D令牌化流水线，结合差分时间令牌编码和步长控制帧稀疏化，使用单一共享帧解码器实现可靠恢复，无需额外时间提取器或重型生成模型。

Result: 在低至0.0004的信道带宽比下仍能保持稳健的视觉和语义一致性，实时重建速度超过30fps，适用于能效敏感、延迟敏感和可靠性关键的无线应用。

Conclusion: Resi-VidTok框架在极低速率和轻量级视频传输方面表现出色，通过令牌重要性排序和信道自适应编码调制，在恶劣SNR条件下提供稳定的质量保证。

Abstract: Real-time transmission of video over wireless networks remains highly
challenging, even with advanced deep models, particularly under severe channel
conditions such as limited bandwidth and weak connectivity. In this paper, we
propose Resi-VidTok, a Resilient Tokenization-Enabled framework designed for
ultra-low-rate and lightweight video transmission that delivers strong
robustness while preserving perceptual and semantic fidelity on commodity
digital hardware. By reorganizing spatio--temporal content into a discrete,
importance-ordered token stream composed of key tokens and refinement tokens,
Resi-VidTok enables progressive encoding, prefix-decodable reconstruction, and
graceful quality degradation under constrained channels. A key contribution is
a resilient 1D tokenization pipeline for video that integrates differential
temporal token coding, explicitly supporting reliable recovery from incomplete
token sets using a single shared framewise decoder--without auxiliary temporal
extractors or heavy generative models. Furthermore, stride-controlled frame
sparsification combined with a lightweight decoder-side interpolator reduces
transmission load while maintaining motion continuity. Finally, a
channel-adaptive source--channel coding and modulation scheme dynamically
allocates rate and protection according to token importance and channel
condition, yielding stable quality across adverse SNRs. Evaluation results
indicate robust visual and semantic consistency at channel bandwidth ratios
(CBR) as low as 0.0004 and real-time reconstruction at over 30 fps,
demonstrating the practicality of Resi-VidTok for energy-efficient,
latency-sensitive, and reliability-critical wireless applications.

Result: 在3GPP标准信道模型上的仿真表明，相比传统方法，Fed-PELAD仅需42.97%的上行通信成本，在异构条件下CSI反馈精度提升1.2 dB。

Conclusion: Fed-PELAD框架有效平衡了通信效率和模型性能，为大规模MIMO系统中的联邦学习应用提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: This paper addresses the critical challenges of communication overhead, data
heterogeneity, and privacy in deep learning for channel state information (CSI)
feedback in massive MIMO systems. To this end, we propose Fed-PELAD, a novel
federated learning framework that incorporates personalized encoders and a
LoRA-adapted shared decoder. Specifically, personalized encoders are trained
locally on each user equipment (UE) to capture device-specific channel
characteristics, while a shared decoder is updated globally via the
coordination of the base station (BS) by using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). This
design ensures that only compact LoRA adapter parameters instead of full model
updates are transmitted for aggregation. To further enhance convergence
stability, we introduce an alternating freezing strategy with calibrated
learning-rate ratio during LoRA aggregation. Extensive simulations on
3GPP-standard channel models demonstrate that Fed-PELAD requires only 42.97\%
of the uplink communication cost compared to conventional methods while
achieving a performance gain of 1.2 dB in CSI feedback accuracy under
heterogeneous conditions.

Conclusion: 提出的TRIS收发器驱动的协作ISCC网络能够有效降低能耗并提升网络性能，为多样化网络需求提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel transmissive reconfigurable intelligent
surface (TRIS) transceiver-driven cooperative integrated sensing, computing,
and communication (ISCC) network to meet the requirement for a diverse network
with low energy consumption. The cooperative base stations (BSs) are equipped
with TRIS transceivers to accomplish sensing data acquisition, communication
offloading, and computation in a time slot. In order to obtain higher
cooperation gain, we utilize a signal-level spatial registration algorithm,
which is realized by adjusting the beamwidth. Meanwhile, for more efficient
offloading of the computational task, multistream communication is considered,
and rank-$N$ constraints are introduced, which are handled using an iterative
rank minimization (IRM) scheme. We construct an optimization problem with the
objective function of minimizing the total energy consumption of the network to
jointly optimize the beamforming matrix, time slot allocation, sensing data
allocation and sensing beam scheduling variables. Due to the coupling of the
variables, the proposed problem is a non-convex optimization problem, which we
decouple and solve using a block coordinate descent (BCD) scheme. Finally,
numerical simulation results confirm the superiority of the proposed scheme in
improving the overall network performance and reducing the total energy
consumption of the network.

Conclusion: 提出的组合工具能精确计算覆盖时间，均匀ℓ-正则模型中的批量抽样模型可能最大化覆盖时间，许多抽样模型共享相同渐近行为但细节差异显著。

Abstract: We study coverage processes in which each draw reveals a subset of $[n]$, and
the goal is to determine the expected number of draws until all items are seen
at least once. A classical example is the Coupon Collector's Problem, where
each draw reveals exactly one item. Motivated by shotgun DNA sequencing, we
introduce a model where each draw is a contiguous window of fixed length, in
both cyclic and non-cyclic variants. We develop a unifying combinatorial tool
that shifts the task of finding coverage time from probability, to a counting
problem over families of subsets of $[n]$ that together contain all items,
enabling exact calculation. Using this result, we obtain exact expressions for
the window models. We then leverage past results on a continuous analogue of
the cyclic window model to analyze the asymptotic behavior of both models. We
further study what we call uniform $\ell$-regular models, where every draw has
size $\ell$ and every item appears in the same number of admissible draws. We
compare these to the batch sampling model, in which all $\ell$-subsets are
drawn uniformly at random and present upper and lower bounds, which were also
obtained independently by Berend and Sher. We conjecture, and prove for special
cases, that this model maximizes the coverage time among all uniform
$\ell$-regular models. Finally, we prove a universal upper bound on the entire
class of uniform $\ell$-regular models, which illuminates the fact that many
sampling models share the same leading asymptotic order, while potentially
differing significantly in lower-order terms.

Abstract: This paper investigates information-theoretic oblivious transfer via a
discrete memoryless broadcast channel with one sender and two receivers. We
analyze both non-colluding and colluding honest-but-curious user models and
establish general upper bounds on the achievable oblivious transfer capacity
region for each case. Two explicit oblivious transfer protocols are proposed.
The first ensures correctness and privacy for independent, non-colluding
receivers by leveraging the structure of binary erasure broadcast channels. The
second protocol, secure even under receiver collusion, introduces additional
entropy-sharing and privacy amplification mechanisms to preserve secrecy
despite information leakage between users. Our results show that for the
non-colluding case, the upper and lower bounds on oblivious transfer capacity
coincide, providing a complete characterization of the achievable region. The
work provides a unified theoretical framework bridging network information
theory and cryptographic security, highlighting the potential of noisy
broadcast channels as powerful primitives for multi-user privacy-preserving

Abstract: Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-assisted full-duplex (FD) terahertz
(THz) communication systems have emerged as a promising paradigm to satisfy the
escalating demand for ultra-high data rates and spectral efficiency in future
wireless networks. However, the practical deployment of such systems presents
unique technical challenges, stemming from severe propagation loss,
frequency-dependent molecular absorption in the THz band, and the presence of
strong residual self-interference (SI) inherent to FD communications. To tackle
these issues, this paper proposes a joint resource allocation framework that
aims to maximize the weighted minimum rate among all users, thereby ensuring
fairness in quality of service. Specifically, the proposed design jointly
optimizes IRS reflecting phase shifts, uplink/downlink transmit power control,
sub-band bandwidth allocation, and sub-band assignment, explicitly capturing
the unique propagation characteristics of THz channels and the impact of
residual SI. To strike an balance between system performance and computational
complexity, two computationally efficient algorithms are developed under
distinct spectrum partitioning schemes: one assumes equal sub-band bandwidth
allocation to facilliate tractable optimization, while the other introduces
adaptive bandwidth allocation to further enhance spectral utilization and
system flexibility. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the
proposed designs and demonstrate that the adopted scheme achieves significant
spectral efficiency improvements over benchmark schemes.

Motivation: 传统CNN计算需要大量硬件资源，而AirCNN旨在利用无线环境实现CNN计算，降低硬件需求并提高能效。

Method: 提出两种RIS辅助传输架构：MIMO和MISO，用于实现2D卷积和深度可分离卷积。联合优化发射预编码器、接收合并器和RIS相移等参数。

Result: 仿真结果显示AirCNN架构能实现满意的分类性能。Conv2d MISO在各种设置下始终优于Conv2d MIMO，而ConvSD中MISO仅在信道条件差时更优。多RIS相比单RIS显著提升性能，特别是在视距主导的无线环境中。

Conclusion: AirCNN证明了通过OTA模拟计算实现CNN的可行性，为无线环境中的神经网络计算提供了新思路，多RIS架构在特定条件下具有明显优势。

Abstract: This paper introduces AirCNN, a novel paradigm for implementing convolutional
neural networks (CNNs) via over-the-air (OTA) analog computation. By leveraging
multiple reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) and transceiver designs, we
engineer the ambient wireless propagation environment to emulate the operations
of a CNN layer. To comprehensively evaluate AirCNN, we consider two types of
CNNs, namely classic two-dimensional (2D) convolution (Conv2d) and light-weight
convolution, i.e., depthwise separable convolution (ConvSD). For Conv2d
realization via OTA computation, we propose and analyze two RIS-aided
transmission architectures: multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) and
multiple-input single-output (MISO), balancing transmission overhead and
emulation performance. We jointly optimize all parameters, including the
transmitter precoder, receiver combiner, and RIS phase shifts, under practical
constraints such as transmit power budget and unit-modulus phase shift
requirements. We further extend the framework to ConvSD, which requires
distinct transmission strategies for depthwise and pointwise convolutions.
Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed AirCNN architectures can
achieve satisfactory classification performance. Notably, Conv2d MISO
consistently outperforms Conv2d MIMO across various settings, while for ConvSD,
MISO is superior only under poor channel conditions. Moreover, employing
multiple RISs significantly enhances performance compared to a single RIS,

Abstract: Linear codes with few weights have been a significant area of research in
coding theory for many years, due to their applications in secret sharing
schemes, authentication codes, association schemes, and strongly regular
graphs. Inspired by the works of Cheng and Gao \cite{P8} and Wu, Li and Zeng
\cite{P12}, in this paper, we propose several new classes of few-weight linear
codes over the finite field $\mathbb{F}_{p}$ through the selection of two
specific defining sets. Consequently, we obtain five classes of $4$-weight
linear codes and one class of $2$-weight linear codes from our first defining
set. Furthermore, by employing weakly regular bent functions in our second
defining set, we derive two classes of $6$-weight codes, two classes of
$8$-weight codes, and one class of $9$-weight codes. The parameters and weight
distributions of all these constructed codes are wholly determined by detailed
calculations on certain Weil sums over finite fields. In addition, we identify
an optimal class of $2$-weight codes that meet the Griesmer bound.

*Hagai Berend,Ohad Elishco,Moshe Schwartz*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 该论文研究了能够纠正权重最多为2的突发错误的多维码，重点分析了三种位置限制情况下的码构造和冗余度比较。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究多维码在纠正权重最多为2的突发错误时的性能，特别关注错误位置之间的相对位置限制对编码效率的影响。

Method: 提出了三种位置限制模型（L∞距离有界、L1距离有界、轴平行线上距离有界），并为每种情况提供了显式的码构造方法。

Result: 针对三种不同的位置限制情况，分别给出了具体的码构造方案，并将这些构造的冗余度与证明的下界进行了比较分析。

Conclusion: 通过系统研究不同位置限制条件下的多维码构造，为纠正权重为2的突发错误提供了有效的编码解决方案，并分析了各种构造方案的冗余度性能。

Abstract: We consider multidimensional codes capable of correcting a burst error of
weight at most $2$. When two positions are in error, the burst limits their
relative position. We study three such limitations: the $L_\infty$ distance
between the positions is bounded, the $L_1$ distance between the positions is
bounded, or the two positions are on an axis-parallel line with bounded
distance between them. In all cases we provide explicit code constructions, and
compare their excess redundancy to a lower bound we prove.

Motivation: 研究图结构数据库复制模型下的SPIR问题，旨在量化相比图复制公共随机性设置下SPIR容量的提升，满足数据库隐私保护需求。

Method: 开发算法将一类PIR方案转换为相应的SPIR方案，为路径图和循环图建立容量下界，并推导比传统PIR容量更紧的上界。

Result: 对于三顶点路径图的特殊情况，确定了SPIR容量为1/2，为路径图和循环图建立了比传统PIR容量更紧的容量上界。

Conclusion: 提出的PIR到SPIR转换算法有效建立了图结构数据库复制模型下的SPIR容量下界，特别在三顶点路径图中精确确定了容量值。

Abstract: We revisit the problem of symmetric private information retrieval (SPIR) in
settings where the database replication is modeled by a simple graph. Here,
each vertex corresponds to a server, and a message is replicated on two servers
if and only if there is an edge between them. To satisfy the requirement of
database privacy, we let all the servers share some common randomness,
independent of the messages. We aim to quantify the improvement in SPIR
capacity, i.e., the maximum ratio of the number of desired and downloaded
symbols, compared to the setting with graph-replicated common randomness.
Towards this, we develop an algorithm to convert a class of PIR schemes into
the corresponding SPIR schemes, thereby establishing a capacity lower bound on
graphs for which such schemes exist. This includes the class of path and cyclic
graphs for which we derive capacity upper bounds that are tighter than the
trivial bounds given by the respective PIR capacities. For the special case of
path graph with three vertices, we identify the SPIR capacity to be
$\frac{1}{2}$.

Motivation: 研究超额增长率这一投资组合理论中的基本对数泛函，探索其与信息论的联系，为超额增长率的重要性提供理论依据，并建立信息论与量化金融之间的新连接。

Method: 使用公理化方法，通过三个特征定理将超额增长率与相对熵、Jensen不等式间隙和对数散度联系起来，同时研究超额增长率的最大化问题并与最优增长投资组合进行比较。

Result: 成功建立了超额增长率与Rényi熵、交叉熵、Helmholtz自由能量、Campbell平均码长和大偏差之间的联系，并通过三个公理化特征定理提供了超额增长率的理论依据。

Conclusion: 该研究不仅为超额增长率的重要性提供了理论支持，还在信息论与量化金融之间建立了新的联系，拓展了两个领域之间的交叉研究。

Abstract: We study the excess growth rate -- a fundamental logarithmic functional
arising in portfolio theory -- from the perspective of information theory. We
show that the excess growth rate can be connected to the R\'{e}nyi and cross
entropies, the Helmholtz free energy, L. Campbell's measure of average code
length and large deviations. Our main results consist of three axiomatic
characterization theorems of the excess growth rate, in terms of (i) the
relative entropy, (ii) the gap in Jensen's inequality, and (iii) the
logarithmic divergence that generalizes the Bregman divergence. Furthermore, we
study maximization of the excess growth rate and compare it with the growth
optimal portfolio. Our results not only provide theoretical justifications of
the significance of the excess growth rate, but also establish new connections
between information theory and quantitative finance.
